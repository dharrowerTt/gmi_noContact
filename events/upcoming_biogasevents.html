</h4>
<div class='detailspara'><p>The Anaerobic Digestion and Bioresources Association (ADBA) is hosting an event on 14 December 2021 to discuss anaerobic digestion (AD) technology. The UK government is subsidizing gas companies to keep the lights on and fertilizer companies to produce CO<sub>2</sub> to keep food on the shelves. AD and biogas could deliver both while also delivering on the UK’s recent commitment to the EU-US Methane Pledge, which seeks to deliver a 30% cut in methane emissions by 2030. That makes this year’s ADBA National Conference pivotal, addressing the barriers to growth of the AD industry.<div><br></div><p></div>
