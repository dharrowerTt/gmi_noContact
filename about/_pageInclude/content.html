                    About the Global Methane Initiative
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Launched in 2004, the GMI is an international public-private initiative that advances cost-effective, near-term methane abatement and recovery and use of methane as a clean energy source in three sectors: biogas (including agriculture, municipal solid waste, and wastewater), coal mines, and oil and gas systems. Focusing collective efforts on methane emission sources is a cost-effective approach to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
                    and increase energy security, enhance economic growth, improve air quality and improve worker safety.
                </p>

                <p>During the 2018 Global Methane Forum, GMI Partners reaffirmed their commitment to the Initiative in the <a href="/documents/GMF_Communique.pdf">Global Methane Initiative Communiqué: Momentum on Methane</a> (PDF, 2 pp), a consensus statement on GMI’s accomplishments over the last 10 years, as well as priorities for the future.</p>

        <p>
            The GMI collaborates routinely with other international organizations and initiatives to create synergies to mitigate methane globally. Working in collaboration with other international organizations, the Initiative has formed key alliances with partners such as the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.unece.org/">United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE)</a> and the <a href="http://www.ccacoalition.org/" target="_blank">Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC)</a> to reduce global methane emissions.

        <p>The GMI consists of a Steering Committee, three technical subcommittees, the Project Network, and the Secretariat (formerly referred to as the Administrative Support Group) that work together to promote project development and encourage active engagement from the private sector.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                The <em><a href="../steering/index.aspx">Steering Committee</a></em>, which
                guides the work of the GMI, is supported by the Secretariat. It governs the Initiative's
                framework, policies and procedures. Partner Countries
                may appoint up to two representatives to the Steering Committee. All Partners are
                considered Steering Committee &quot;observers&quot; from the time they join the
                Initiative. Twelve months after joining and any time thereafter, Partner Countries
                may submit a request to become a Steering Committee member by sending a letter to the Secretariat that outlines
                their <a href="../documents/GMI_Engagement-Activities-Examples.pdf">engagement</a> (PDF, 1
                p., 30 KB) in the Initiative.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <em><a href="../secretariat/index.aspx">Secretariat</a></em>, currently
                hosted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, provides administrative and logistical support and also serves
                as an information clearinghouse.
            </p>

            <p>
                The <!--<em><a href="../sectors/sectors.aspx">Technical Subcommittees</a></em>-->Technical Subcommittees are organized by the main sources of methane
                emissions. Partner Countries appoint technical experts from either the government
                or the private sector to the technical subcommittees.
                Each <!--<a href="/sectors/index.aspx">subcommittee</a>-->subcommittee has developed a
                Subcommittee Action Plan that identifies the needs, opportunities and priorities
                for project development globally as well as key barriers and strategies to address
                them. The subcommittees are focusing their efforts on developing
                <a href="../documents/GMI_PartnerSectorActionPlansAppendix_REV_June2013.pdf">
                    Partner
                    Sector Action Plans
                </a> (PDF, 3 pp, 139 KB) to provide more detailed information
                to assist project development in each respective Partner Country. The technical
                subcommittees also facilitate investment and financing opportunities and other cooperative
                activities and projects to advance the abatement and recovery of methane and its
                use as an energy source. To take advantage of shared considerations and opportunities, the GMI recently created the Biogas Subcommittee.
                Technical groups for agriculture, municipal solid waste, and wastewater are organized within the Biogas Subcommittee.
            </p>

            <p>
                The <em><a href="../project-network/index.aspx">Project Network</a></em> consists of representatives from industry,
                the research community, financial institutions, state and local governments and other expert stakeholders with an interest in
                developing and supporting methane abatement, recovery, and use projects in Partner Countries. Project Network members share
                their technical expertise, experience, and financial resources and are encouraged to attend subcommittee meetings and participate
                in developing sector-specific Action Plans. They also participate in specific activities such as capacity building, technology
                transfer, and outreach. By participating in the Project Network, these organizations are identifying potential project opportunities,
                making connections, staying informed and gaining recognition for their achievements.
            </p>
