        		<h1>Terms of Reference</h1>

                    <h2>Terms of Reference for the Global Methane Initiative</h2>
                    	<p>The undersigned national government entities  (collectively referred to as &quot;the Partners&quot;) set forth the following Terms of  Reference for the Global Methane Initiative (referred to as &quot;the Initiative&quot;).  The Initiative serves as a framework with the goal of achieving global  reductions of anthropogenic methane emissions through partnerships among  developed countries, developing countries, and countries with economies in  transition in coordination with the private sector, researchers, development  banks, and other relevant governmental and non-governmental organizations.</p>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
                    	<p>To create a voluntary,  non-binding framework for international cooperation to reduce methane emissions  and to advance the recovery and use of methane as a valuable clean energy  source to increase energy security,  enhance economic growth, improve air quality, and improve industrial safety. The Initiative will focus on the development of strategies  and markets for the abatement, recovery, and use of methane through technology development,  demonstration, deployment and diffusion, implementation of effective policy  frameworks, identification of ways and means to support investment, and removal  of barriers to collaborative project development and implementation.  The Initiative will serve to complement and support Partners' efforts  implemented under the United Nations' Framework Convention on Climate Change.</p>
