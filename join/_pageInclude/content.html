                    Join A Subcommittee
                </h1>
                <p>GMI’s Technical Subcommittees are organized by the three main sources of methane emissions globally: Oil & Gas, Biogas, and Coal Mines. These three Subcommittees support methane emissions reduction by providing collaboration opportunities, capacity-building support, and technical assistance to remove technical and non-technical barriers to methane mitigation project development. The Subcommittees also facilitate investment and financing opportunities and other cooperative activities and projects to advance the abatement, recovery, and use of methane.  </p>
