          <h2>India: Gorai Landfill, Mumbai, Maharastra State, India</h2>
            
              <p><em>Background</em><br />
              The Gorai Landfill, located  outside Mumbai, is owned by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM)  and was operated as an open dump that served the city from 1972 until 2007.  Currently, as part of a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) project, MCGM has  closed the site and installed a methane capture and destruction system. Closure  and capping activities were performed by M/S United Phosphorus Limited, with  consultation from IL&amp;FS Ecosmart, who also is providing MCGM with  assistance in commercializing Certified Emissions Reductions (CERs). </p>
              <p>The Gorai  Landfill has the potential to earn $5.2 million (USD) for carbon credits for  captured gas. Although the landfill gas is currently flared, local officials  plan to reuse it to generate electricity eventually. The municipal corporation  of Mumbai signed an emission reduction purchase agreement with the Asian Development Bank for future  delivery of carbon credits. The carbon credits are determined by the estimated  reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases from the capped landfill. Methane  and other greenhouse gases are the product of 35 years and 2.3 million tons of  accumulated solid waste at the site. In addition to addressing the  environmental problems related to the disposal of waste, the capture and reuse  of gas at the Gorai Landfill provides a local source of energy as well as  revenue from the carbon credits. The <a href="../activities/actActivityDetailsForLandfill.aspx?myObjId=a07G000000ONE6kIAH&mySiteObjId=a09A0000004vIO1IAM">initial  feasibility study</a> for this project was funded by the U.S. Agency for  International Development and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency provided  additional technical support to the municipality.</p>
              <p><em>Project  status</em><br />
                As of early  2010, the landfill final cap and cover had been completed and landfill gas  utilization projects were being assessed, with onsite uses likely limited to  leachate evaporation. The project is still  under the registration phase of the CDM process and is recovering an average of  684 cubic meters per hour of biogas.</p>
              <p><em>Emissions reductions</em><br />
                The  project study estimates that the Gorai Landfill has the potential to reduce  emissions by 2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent over the  lifetime of the project. These reductions are assumed to come from flaring between  2009 and 2028. </p>
