                <ul>
                    <li>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pilotauctionfacility.org/">Pilot Auction Facility (PAF)</a> is an innovative climate finance model developed by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.worldbank.org/">World Bank Group</a> to stimulate investment in projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions while maximizing the impact of public funds and leveraging private sector financing.</li>
                    <li>Its results-based payment mechanism will set a floor price for future carbon credits in the form of a tradeable put option, which will be competitively allocated via auctions.</li>
                    <li>The PAF is backed by Germany, Sweden, and the United States, while Switzerland is considering a pledge.  The facility has a capitalization target of $100 million. In a first phase, it will support projects that cut methane emissions at landfill, animal waste, and wastewater sites facing low carbon prices.</li>
                </ul>

            <p>The PAF is an innovative, pay-for-performance mechanism which uses auctions to allocate scarce public funds and attract private sector investment to projects that reduce methane emissions, taking advantage of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) infrastructure already in place for implementation.</p>
            <p>The key objective of the PAF is to demonstrate a new, cost-effective climate finance mechanism that incentivizes private sector investment and action in climate change in developing countries by providing a guaranteed floor price on carbon reduction credits. The guaranteed floor price would be delivered through the auctioning of put options supported by donor funding.</p>
            <p>In its first phase, the PAF will support projects that cut methane emissions at landfill, animal waste, and wastewater sites. The facility will deliver quick impact by initially targeting the 1,200 methane reducing projects which are at risk of decommissioning due to the low price of carbon credits. The facility has a strong potential for replication and quick scaling up, in methane or other sectors.</p>
                <p>GMI will provide further details as they become available.</p>
