          <h2>China: Gaoantun Landfill, Beijing, China</h2>
            
              <p><em>Background</em><br />
              Gaoantun Landfill is a sanitary landfill  owned and operated by the Beijing Chaoyang District Garbage Innocent   Disposal Center.  In 2007, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) conducted  a pump test and produced a pre-feasibility study on the potential to  expand landfill gas (LFG) utilization at this site. This prefeasibility study  is available in <a href="../activities/actActivityDetailsForLandfill.aspx?myObjId=a07A000000D4HCLIA3&mySiteObjId=a09A0000004vIJoIAM">English</a> and <a href="../activities/actActivityDetailsForLandfill.aspx?myObjId=a07A000000D4HCLIA3&mySiteObjId=a09A0000004vIJoIAM">Chinese</a>.</p>
              <p>Phase 1 of the landfill was planned and  constructed with 52 extraction wells converted from passive vents, all  installed before waste placement. As of July 2007, these were collecting LFG.  The owners then installed a 500 kilowatt (kW) reciprocating engine generator to  generate electricity for the leachate treatment plant. A second 500 kW engine  was installed in 2009. Phase 2 of the landfill involved installing 24 passive  vents, which have been flaring gas as of July 2007.</p>
              <p><em>Future gas potential</em><br />
                The  landfill is expected to close in 2014 with approximately 8.0 million tons of  waste in place. Preliminary  biogas modeling estimates that 1,790 cubic meters per hour of biogas at 50  percent methane with 65 percent collection efficiency can be recovered for capture  and use in 2010 (in addition to 630 cubic meters per hour used by the two 500  kW engines).</p>
              <p>The original study estimated that the initial  gas production at the closing of the mine in 2014 would be 1,852 standard cubic  feet per minute (scfm) and that it would continually decrease after site  closure in that year. The study estimated the production to fall to 528 scfm by  the year 2027. The study also estimated that the gas would be able to supply an  additional 3 megawatts of engine-generator capacity.</p>
              <p>There is still gas being flared at the site,  so there are investment opportunities to find productive uses for this gas. Also, in  addition to the energy used on-site, energy will be available to sell to  potential end users near the landfill.</p>
              <p><em>Emissions  reductions</em><br />
                The original U.S. EPA study estimated that  the expansion of the electricity generation project could reduce emissions by more  than 300,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO<sub>2</sub>E) for the period 2008 to 2022 by displacing  electricity produced from other sources. Additionally, U.S. EPA estimated that direct  uses of the gas in nearby facilities would reduce emissions by more than  200,000 MTCO<sub>2</sub>E in other source displacement over the same  time period. Together, this project has the potential to reduce more than a  half a million MTCO<sub>2</sub>E in the period leading up to 2022.</p>
