          <h2>China: CMM Purification &amp; Utilization Project at the Coal Mines of Songzao Coal Mining Area, Chongqing Municipality, China</h2>
            
              <p><em>Background</em><br />
              The  Chongqing Energy Investment Group (CEIG) and its subsidiary, Songzao Coal and  Electricity Company (SCEC), are developing a project to gather, purify, and  liquefy as much as 130 million cubic meters annually of medium-purity coal mine  methane (CMM) from Songzao's six operating coal mines in Chongqing  Municipality, in southwest China. The  resultant liquefied natural gas (LNG) will be transported by truck for use in both  locally and in booming natural gas consumption centers to the south and east.</p>
              <p>The  provincial government owners are considering adding a second plant with an annual  capacity of 40 million cubic meters for purification and liquefaction for  increased methane production from these mines in the future. The project also  includes the construction of a 26.9 megawatt internal combustion engine at power  stations at new Songzao mines, which will burn an additional 38 million cubic  meters per year of CMM that cannot be transported economically to the LNG  plant.</p>
              <p>First  presented at the 2007 Methane to Markets Partnership Expo in Beijing, the project is built on the analysis  of a <a href="http://www.epa.gov/cmop/docs/feasibility_study.pdf">feasibility  study</a> (PDF, 150 pp, 9.8MB) <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx" title="Exiting Global Methane Initiative"><img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a> conducted in 2008-2009 with the support of the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency under the Methane to Markets Partnership.</p>
              <p><em>Emissions reductions</em><br />
                The  owners anticipate that the project will come online in 2012 and will generate  approximately 2.93 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO<sub>2</sub>E)  of emissions reductions annually and 44 million MTCO<sub>2</sub>E over its  15-year lifetime.</p>
              <p><em>CMM  use</em><br />
                While  the gas collection and transportation infrastructures are limited, large and  growing markets farther away indicate a potential profitability for this  project in the future. Chongqing is the closest  end-use market, but other municipalities in nearby southeast China are large  and represent a growing demand for LNG.</p>
              <p>Also,  SCEC provides drained CMM for free for miners' families, local townspeople, and  commercial enterprises to use for hot water heating, cooking, and in public  facilities in the mining area, such as cafeterias and small district heating  boilers. Civil consumption ranges from 65 to 85 million cubic meters of CMM  annually.</p>
              <p><em>Co-benefits</em><br />
                The  project will significantly improve the health and safety for workers and  residences by providing a new source of clean energy and decreasing coal-fired pollution  emissions. The region will benefit from improved air quality by reducing  emissions from mining.</p>
