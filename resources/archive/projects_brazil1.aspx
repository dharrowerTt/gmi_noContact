          <h2>Brazil: Solid Waste Treatment Center at Belo Horizonte Landfill (Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais)</h2>
            
              <p><em>Background</em><br />
              Cons&oacute;rcio Horizonte Asja, a  joint venture between Asja Brasil Servi&ccedil;os Para o Meio Ambiente Ltda. and Aria  Biz S.A, is developing a biogas collection and use project at the closed Belo  Horizonte Landfill, which is owned and controlled by the Municipality of Belo Horizonte. The United States Environmental  Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) provided assistance conducting a site assessment  to evaluate the opportunities.</p>
                <p>The landfill complied with commonly accepted  standards for sanitary landfills in Brazil. Waste was moved into place  in an organized manner, compacted, and covered daily. The landfill has gas  vents, leachate drains, and an impermeable bottom liner. The project consists of a gas collection and  treatment system and an electricity generation plant connected to the electrical  grid.</p>
                <p><em>Emissions reductions</em><br />
                  The landfill expects to reduce annual  emissions by an average of 134,160 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent each  year for ten years, totaling nearly 1.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.</p>
                <p><em>Economic  benefits and energy production</em><br />
                  The assessment report estimated  that sufficient landfill biogas could be recovered to generate 9 megawatts (MW)  of power in 2009. However, power that could be generated would decrease rapidly  after the first few years of operation as the supply of decomposable waste  became depleted. The report estimated a power plant capacity of 5 MW to yield  the greatest net present value.</p>
                <p>The project also intends to make financial  gains through the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). Cons&oacute;rcio  Horizonte Asja has submitted documents to register the project in the CDM for  Certified Emission Reductions commercialization.</p>
