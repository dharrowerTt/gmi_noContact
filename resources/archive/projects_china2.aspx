          <h2>China: Chongqing Datong Coal Mine VAM Destruction and Utilization Project</h2>
            
              <p><em>Background</em><br />
               The Datong mine project, located in the Chongqing  Municipality in Southwest   China, will destroy ventilation air methane (VAM) with methane  oxidization technology. The heat generated during oxidization will be used to  produce hot water for coal mine workers.</p>
              <p>Three  sets of methane oxidization systems, which consist of six MEGTEC VOCSIDIZERS&trade;,  as well as supporting systems to capture ventilation air from the ventilation  system, will be installed. Each VOCSIDIZER&trade; is designed to treat 62,500 Normal cubic meters (Nm<sup>3</sup>) of ventilation air  per hour at an average methane concentration of 0.5 percent.</p>
              <p>Construction  of the project is scheduled to begin in 2010 and will begin operating later in  the year continuing for a total of 20 years. The projected total capital investment  for the project is estimated to be $7.68 million (USD).</p>
              <p><em>Emissions reductions</em><br />
                This  project is estimated to reduce emissions by 132,000 metric tons of carbon  dioxide equivalent (MTCO<sub>2</sub>E) annually. Over the 20 years, the  emissions reductions will total approximately 2.5 MTCO<sub>2</sub>E.</p>
              <p><em>Mine safety</em><br />
                This  project will also enhance the safety and work conditions of mine workers. They will  have access to hot water generated from onsite energy production from the  harvested methane and the reduced methane in the mine will significantly reduce  the risk of explosions.</p>
          <p><em>Market and demand</em><br />
            The Chongqing Municipality, which is surrounded by Sichuan province, is  large, densely populated, and commercially important. This municipality has  high energy needs, so the use of otherwise wasted coal mine methane and VAM yields  both environmental and economic  benefits.</p>
