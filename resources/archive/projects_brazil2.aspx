          <h2>Brazil: Frigorifico Mabella/Marfrig Group Swine Project</h2>
            
              <p><em>Background</em><br />
Frigor&iacute;fico  Mabella (Marfrig Group) is a nine-year old pork processing, swine production,  and trading company in the Matto Grosso province of Brazil.  The project was implemented in the &quot;Diamantino 1&quot; swine production site, where 11,000  sows live in a typical confined animal feed operation (CAFO) site.</p>
              <p>Originally, the farm used electricity supplied by the local  electric grid, part of the Brazilian National Interconnected System. In the  first phase of the project, a biogas power plant with five small generator groups,  with an approximate 700 kilowatts of electric (kWe) capacity in continuous  operation, was installed to supply the farm with electricity. In the second  phase, two generating sets with nominal power of 925 - 1,038 kWe were installed  to consume all of the biogas generated at the site. The project is registering  daily production of around 15,000 cubic meters (m<sup>3</sup>) of biogas and is  expected to produce about 20,000 m<sup>3</sup> per day.</p>
              <p>Although this type of project has been already implemented  in Brazil,  Mabella's project is superior to all the others in terms of engineering, designing,  and equipment. It combines high technology with simple designing, which makes  it financially attractive, and should be used as an international example. Project  designers leveraged their accumulated experience to include numerous details in  the project, which will prevent failures and prolong the project lifetime. Considering  that most swine manure projects in Brazil with anaerobic digestion  systems flare methane instead of using it, this project can be considered  state-of-art.</p>
              <p>LOGICarbon, the contractor for this project, began designing  the project in July 2008, just as the open lagoons were starting to be cleaned.  Construction started in early 2009 and concluded in February 2010. The  inauguration took place on March 2010. The current project has a 700 kW biogas  plant already generating electricity for the farm's consumption (it is  self-sufficient), and the next step is to reach a total capacity of 2 megawatts.</p>
              <p><em>Environmental and  economic benefits</em><br />
                This  project will reduce greenhouse gas emissions over its lifetime. The project  will reduce methane and nitrous oxide emissions by approximately 75,000 metric  tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO<sub>2</sub>E) annually and, as long as  the swine farm operates at current levels and continues to capture and use methane,  it has the potential to reduce the emissions of 1 million MTCO<sub>2</sub>E within  15 years.</p>
              <p>The  project also has a considerable market potential. After the initial project  implementation costs of slightly more than $1 million (USD), the project will  generate slightly less than $1 million annually in electricity savings and  sales. Required maintenance costs of slightly less than $500,000 (USD) per  year. The initial investment for implementation should be recovered within two  years, making this a highly profitable project in both the short and long term.</p>
              <p>The project was presented to the Brazilian authorities in September  2008. Validation was concluded in February 2010 and now the project is waiting  for approval by the Brazilian Government. LOGICarbon expects to register the  project at the UNFCCC in November 2010. Soon the project expects to generate Clean  Development Mechanism carbon credits from the combustion of the captured methane.</p>
