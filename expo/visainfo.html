<h2>Visa Information</h2>

<p>Please see below for some information and useful links from Citizenship and Immigration Canada.</p>


<h3>Submission of Applications</h3>

<p>Canada does not have a visa office in every country so it is important that participants visit the website of the visa office responsible for processing their visa application for information on how to submit an application for a TRV and the documentation required to support the application. <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/ENGLISH/information/offices/apply-where.asp">Find a list of visa offices and the countries they serve here</a>.</p>


<h3>Visa Application Centres (VACs)</h3>

<p>In some countries Citizenship and Immigration Canada has engaged the services of a private service provider to assist individuals applying for CIC services.</p>

<p>Visa Application Centres (VACs) agents are available to help applicants fill out forms and answer questions about the application process. They ensure applications are complete, which reduces the rate of returned applications and ultimately leads to faster processing. This low-cost service lessens the potential for people to fall victim of fraud.</p>

<p>The VAC sends applications to Visa offices and transmits decisions to applicants in a confidential manner.</p>

<p>VACs play no role in the decision-making process. The use of VAC services is completely optional. Applicants can continue to apply directly to the visa office if they prefer.</p>

<p>Participants are encouraged to submit their visa applications through a VAC if this service is available in their country of residence. Please check your <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/ENGLISH/information/offices/apply-where.asp">visa office website</a> for information on the services available at the VAC serving your area and the costs.</p>


<h3>Instructional Videos on how to complete TRV applications</h3>

<p>CIC has available on its internet site <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/department/media/multimedia/video/imm5257/imm5257.asp">instructional videos on how to complete the TRV application online</a>. We encourage you to watch the video to ensure the applications are completed correctly. The videos are available in English, French and Spanish.</p>

 
<h3>Visa Applications Processing Times</h3>

<p>Processing time for TRVs vary depending on the office and the time of the year (i.e. Ankara 133 days, Beirut 36 days based on a complete application). We encourage you to apply early for your visa, if one is required, and to submit complete applications including all supporting documents.</p>

<p>For your information, <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/information/times/temp/visitors.asp"><strong>general</strong> processing times at the various visa offices are available here</a>. For more accurate processing times, applicants should consult the website for the visa office responsible for processing their application.</p>


<h3>Refusals</h3>

<p>The global acceptance rate for visitor visas is approximately 80% and in the first quarter of 2011 the rate was 82%.</p>


<h3>What to do if an application is refused</h3>

<p>If an individual's visa application is denied, the applicant will be informed in writing. If there is new information that was not previously considered or if circumstances have changed since the refusal, the applicant may wish to submit a new application. Please note that unless the applicant provides further information that addresses the concerns raised in the refusal letter, the applicant will likely get the same results. Every person applying for a visa must satisfy the requirements under IRPA in order for the visa officer to approve the applications. Applicants are advised to submit complete applications, including all supporting documents, in accordance with the instructions provided in the visa office website.</p>
