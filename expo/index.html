<h2>Event Highlights and Expo Venue</h2>

<h2><em>Event Highlights</em></h2>

It matters in our fight against global warming, in the quality of our air, water cycle, and crop yields. And it matters to our health."</em> - The Honourable Peter Kent, Minister of the Environment of Canada, Methane Expo 2013 keynote speech
</p>

<p>The Expo agenda included high-level plenary sessions headlined by Canada’s Environment Minister, the Honourable Peter Kent; Acting GMI Steering Committee Chair Ms. Janet McCabe, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); and British Columbia’s Minister of Environment, the Honourable Terry Lake.</p>

<p>Other Expo highlights included programming from all five subcommittees, and more than 90 project opportunities and success story posters that showcased the real, on the ground accomplishments of GMI. Peppered though the municipal solid waste (MSW) posters were photos from Tim Bouldry, who captures images of people living nearby landfills. Another popular session was on international methane financing with speakers from the International Development Bank, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and SENES Consulting.</p>

<p>A well-attended municipal leaders’ forum with representatives from Colombia, Canada and Sweden explored different ways to overcome common sustainability issues under municipal jurisdiction. Finally, the Climate and Clean Air Coalition to Reduce Short-Lived Climate Pollutants (CCAC) and the Center for Clean Air Policy (CCAP) hosted side meetings.</p>

<p>The Steering group of the CCAC MSW initiative provided an opportunity for cities from around the world to come together to develop action plans to mitigate methane and black carbon from the municipal solid waste sector, and consider solutions like organics management and methane capture from landfills.</p>

<p>At the CCAP MSW event, representatives from Colombia, Chile and Dominican Republic presented the results of the development of integrated solid waste management Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMA) supported by Canada through its $1.2 billion Fast-Start Financing commitment.</p>
