                        <h3>One Window Access for Researchers and Innovators</h3>
                        <p>The innovation journey is complex and expensive for new technologies that reduce methane and
                            SLCP emissions in the oil and gas industry. A wide range of technical requirements must be
                            met in diverse settings, while providing low-cost solutions that comply with regulations.
                            Innovators struggle to gain access to all of the required test facilities that allow them to
                            address these complexities. CanERIC streamlines this journey for researchers and innovators
                            by providing simplified access to all facility types along the innovation pathway, from labs
                            to field production sites. In addition, CanERIC helps to ensure that technology providers
                            and researchers are informed about the specific challenges faced by producers and
                            regulators. This information fosters the development of market-driven technologies that also
                            satisfy
                            regulatory requirements.</p>

                        <h3>Open Information Sharing Platform</h3>
                        <p>Innovation is currently hampered and delayed by barriers to information; therefore, CanERIC
                            will enable a centralized,
                            national-level hub for information collection and dissemination. Stakeholders, particularly
                            researchers and
                            technology developers, have indicated that easier and faster access to highly relevant
                            information would accelerate their workflow and reduce their cost by more accurately
                            targeting market requirements.

                            PTAC is founded on two pillars: innovation and collaboration. PTAC’s consortia developed the
                            collective technology capacity to help Canada’s oil & gas sector reduce overall methane
                            emissions by more than 30 percent in the last decade. By 2021, PTAC aims to increase
                            technology capacity to meet Canada’s oil & gas industry target for reducing methane
                            emissions by 45 percent by 2025.

                            between the project participants and PTAC that defines milestones and establishes procedures
                            for measuring, reporting, and documenting actions to ensure that project goals are met.</p>

                            gas industry, PTAC, in collaboration with their industry partners, developed the Methane
                            Emissions Reduction Network (MERN). MERN unlocks opportunities for innovators, academic
                            researchers, and subject matter experts (SME) to connect with and learn from end users, as
                            well as local and international peers. In developing MERN, PTAC addressed a critical need to
                            dramatically reduce methane and other greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through industry
                            awareness and collaboration, while accelerating the development of decisive technologies.
