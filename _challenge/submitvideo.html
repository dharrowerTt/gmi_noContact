        <h2>Enhance your story with a video!</h2>
        <p>We would love to get a video of your story from your perspective and in your language. Your video could show
            a
            demonstration of a technology, a tour of a facility, or a discussion with your project team about the
            significance of the actions you are taking or who you worked with to make it a success. We specifically
            invite
            you to highlight the potential or expected results and benefits of your actions, to help others understand
            the
            value of what you’re doing to reduce methane emissions. We welcome and encourage your creativity in
            conveying
            your story. Videos will be made available for viewing on GMI’s website, promoted in GMI communications, and
            featured in social media. Your video will also be embedded on your Challenge story.</p>

        <p>First, submit your Challenge story, then upload the optional video that captures your activities by clicking
            <a href="https://forms.gle/p76TT6ue6AmLpodY7" target="_blank">here</a>. For your video to be featured at the
            <a href="https://www.globalmethane.org/gmf2020/" target="_blank">Global Methane Forum</a> in Geneva,
            Switzerland in March 2020, you must
            submit the video by 31 January 2020. If you submit a video after 31 January 2020, your video will be posted
            alongside your submission on the Challenge website.</p>
