                    In November 2018 the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC) Municipal Solid Waste Initiative (Waste
                    Initiative) organized a study tour of organic waste treatment facilities in Northern Italy for
                    a group of municipal representatives from the Republic of Serbia. The study tour was designed to help raise
                    awareness of best practices for organic waste management that could be applied in Serbian
                    municipalities, and assist them in developing strategies for adopting those practices. This
                    exchange builds on ongoing technical assistance and project development support provided by
                    several international partners, including the Serbian Solid Waste Association (SeSWA), the U.S.
                    Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), German Federal Enterprise for International Cooperation
                    (GIZ), and THINK Cities.

                    The Waste Initiative has been supporting efforts to improve solid waste management and reduce
                    emissions of short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) in Serbia since 2015. Through SeSWA, the Waste
                    Initiative’s regional implementer, the initiative has conducted workshops on developing action
                    plans to address SLCP emissions and accessing financing for projects. SeSWA has also provided
                    capacity building support to a handful of cities, assisting them in collecting solid waste data,
                    identifying priorities for improving solid waste management, and building relationships with
                    potential funders.</p>
                <p>At the same time, EPA and GIZ have been assisting the municipality of Novi Sad and the surrounding
                    South Backa Waste Management Region (SBWMR) in assessing the potential for a small-scale composting
                    project. EPA, with assistance from Altereko, conducted a pre-feasibility study for the project
                    using the Waste Initiative’s OrganEcs tool (see the text box) in 2018. Based on that assessment,
                    GIZ is providing technical and financial assistance for the design and construction of a project in
                    the town of Vrbas, under its Climate Sensitive Waste Management (DKTI) program. The project is
                    expected to be constructed in 2019. </p>

                <p>
                    The study tour focused on four Italian cities with varying populations and differing waste
                    management systems. It included technical visits focused on biowaste collection options and compost
                    treatment systems. Participants also had the opportunity to interact with Italian municipal
                    officials in charge of overseeing waste operations.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In Verona, the group visited a waste collection point, and observed the city’s organic waste
                        “bring scheme” and dry material recycling collection system.</li>
                    <li>In Parma, the group met with the municipal Department of Environmental Services to discuss
                        details of the city’s waste management system. The group also met with the city’s waste
                        collection coordinator to view organic waste collection.</li>
                    <li>In Castiglione delle Stiviere, the group viewed the collection of non-differentiated waste and
                        biowaste in the town’s residential neighborhoods. The group also met with the technical
                        director of BioCiclo, one of the city’s waste management system operators. Participants toured
                        a 45,000 tons/year large-scale composting facility that treats biowaste for the entire region.
                        Castiglione, given its medium size and more limited resources, is most representative of towns
                        in Serbia.</li>
                    <li>The final tour city was Bolzano, which is implementing a biowaste door-to-door collection
                        scheme. Tour participants shadowed a biowaste collection crew and met with city waste
                        management officials to learn more about Bolzano’s biowaste collection and treatment systems.
                        To conclude the tour, participants visited a 2,000 ton/year small-scale composting facility.
                        Bolzano exemplifies how small communities without a centralized waste system can utilize a
                        network of small composting facilities, a low-tech option that could apply to small Serbian
                        municipalities.
