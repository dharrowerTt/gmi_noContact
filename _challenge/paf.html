                </h2>
                <p> <img src="images/paf/logo.jpg" style="width: 100%;">
                    <br><br>In 2013, the Group of Eight (G8) highly industrialized nations requested innovative
                    approaches to address methane emissions. A report by the Methane Finance Study Group found that a
                    large and growing number of abatement opportunities existed in developing countries; however, in
                    many cases, projects were not implemented due to financial and other barriers. The World Bank
                    created the <a href="https://www.pilotauctionfacility.org/" target="_blank">Pilot Auction Facility
                        for Methane and Climate Change Mitigation</a> (PAF) as an innovative, pay-for-performance model to
                    stimulate investment in projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions while maximizing the impact of
                    public funds and leveraging private sector financing. The PAF has demonstrated a cost-effective,
                    results-based climate finance mechanism that incentivizes private sector investment and action on
                    climate change in developing countries by guaranteeing a minimum price for carbon credits that
                    represent emission reductions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While the PAF is a global action, the World Bank believes that PAF’s climate auction model could be
                    applied to support domestic climate targets and actions. Countries have made nationally determined
                    contributions to the Paris Agreement that will require a greater scale and pace of action. Climate
                    auctions are a financing mechanism that can help public funders achieve the best value for
                    incentivizing private sector actions and can help countries achieve their targets in the short-term,
                    while supporting carbon pricing and greater climate ambition in the medium- to long-term.
                </p>

                <h3>About the Auctions</h3>
                <p>
                    The PAF hosts auctions for price guarantees of future emission reductions of methane. Participating
                    companies compete to set a minimum price for carbon credits for methane-reducing projects. The
                    projects that require the lowest guaranteed price for carbon credits win the auction. The PAF’s
                    auctions have been held with multilateral support and have been nearly global in scope. The
                    internet-based auctions allow potential investors from different parts of the world to bid for put
                    options and secure a payment for future carbon credits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The PAF’s resources are only disbursed after the emission reductions underlying the carbon credits
                    have been independently verified, making climate auctions a pay-for-performance model. Projects have
                    to demonstrate to a third-party auditor that they adhered to a list of PAF’s environmental, health,
                    and safety guidelines, which are largely based on the International Finance Corporation’s
                    Performance Standards. This ensures that the projects and their host sites are well managed.

                <h3>Measuring Success</h3>
                <p>
                    The main indicator for measuring progress is the amount of carbon credits redeemed by the auction
                    winners during the different redemption periods. Redemption levels have been high in all redemption
                    windows, demonstrating progress in methane abatement. As of December 2019, winners have redeemed 93
                    percent of PAFERNs (Pilot Auction Facility Emissions Reductions Notes), representing 10.3 million
                    metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO<sub>2</sub>e). An independent evaluation published in 2019 found that the PAF demonstrated its
                    relevance for the climate change market and viability of an auction for tradable climate assets,
                    successfully tested different auction formats and generated lessons learned, and proved effective in
                    allocating scarce funding to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The PAF also measures success through communications with investors and project developers. For
                    example:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The majority of respondents indicated that the price guarantee offered by the PAF allowed
                            them to keep their abatement projects operating</li>
                        <li>For the Jeram landfill gas recovery project in Malaysia, PAF’s price guarantee allowed the
                            project to mobilize (or redeploy within the project) an additional 50 percent of funding of
                            the amount received by the PAF</li>
                        <li>The project Central de Resíduos do Recreio Landfill Gas Project (CRRLGP) in Brazil has
                            avoided emissions estimated at 3 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub>e</li>
                        <li>According to the respondents, the abatement projects have contributed to better air and
                            water quality, improved human health, and expanded economic growth</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
