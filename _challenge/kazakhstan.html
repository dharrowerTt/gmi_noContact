                <p>
                    The Kazakhstan Ministry of Energy, Department of Renewable Energy, is interested in developing an initiative to
                    analyze the potential for biogas recovery and utilization in the municipal wastewater treatment
                    sector. The initial work is being undertaken with the collaboration of the Global Methane Initiative (GMI)
                    and includes technical analyses, benchmarking against international norms and best practices,
                    identification of the cost-effectiveness of biogas recovery, developing policy recommendations and
                    regulatory initiatives, and supporting technical training of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP)
                    operators.</p>
                <p>
                    The Department of Renewable Energy also considers this effort as a proxy for developing broader
                    support for biogas utilization, including in solid waste disposal and agricultural waste, in the
                    context of renewable energy development and emissions reductions.
                </p>
                <div class="callout">
                    <p>In support of this effort, the following actions are being undertaken:</p>

                    <p><b>Stakeholders Meeting:</b> The convening of a one-day meeting of high-level decision-makers to
                        review existing knowledge and activities in biogas production and utilization, and present
                        current efforts in the municipal wastewater sector. International experiences were presented to
                        contribute to a better understanding of what may be possible in Kazakhstan. This meeting took
                        place in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan on 3 April 2019.</p>

                    <p><b>Pre-feasibility Studies:</b> A technical team from the U.S. and Kazakhstan, organized by the
                        engineering company Tetra Tech, and sponsored by GMI, will carry out technical and economic
                        pre-feasibility studies at two selected wastewater treatment plants representative of the WWTP
                        sector in Kazakhstan (a large plant in the North and a medium-sized plant in the South),
                        focusing on the technologies and costs of methane capture and utilization. Four plants were
                        visited in early April 2019, and detailed data from the two plants will be used to carry out the
                        pre-feasibility analysis. Results will be presented at the <a
                            href="https://www.globalmethane.org/news-events/event_detailsbyID.aspx?eventid=517">Water
                            Expo Central Asia 2019</a> on 29-30
                        May 2019.</p>

                    <p><b>Technical Training Workshop:</b> A workshop for WWTP operators will focus on the techniques
                        and technologies for biogas recovery, and preliminary costs for such designs. The workshop will
                        be based on international best practices in the context of the WWTP sector in Kazakhstan, and
                        will include the results of the pre-feasibility studies based on local data. Calculation
                        exercises will assist in underlining key technical parameters. The Technical Training Workshop
                        will be held in Almaty on 28 May 2019.</p>

                    <p><b>Conference Presentation:</b> The results of the pre-feasibility studies and the implications
                        for the WWTP sector in Kazakhstan will be summarized in a key presentation at the <a
                            href="https://www.globalmethane.org/news-events/event_detailsbyID.aspx?eventid=517">Water
                            Expo Central Asia 2019</a>.</p>

                    <p><b>Legislative and Regulatory Roadmap:</b> The Department of Renewable Energy in the Ministry of
                        Energy recognizes the need to provide regulatory certainty, and possible incentives, for biogas
                        projects to move forward in Kazakhstan. With this in mind, it is undertaking a roadmap exercise
                        that will identify and prioritize concrete actions to promote legal and regulatory support for
                        biogas. With GMI’s assistance, this roadmap will focus on biogas from municipal wastewater as a
                        proxy for broader biogas generation, including from solid waste and agricultural activities. The
                        roadmap effort will include:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Analysis of strategic documents, such as the national and regional development programs, the
                            promotion of a “green economy” in Kazakhstan, greenhouse gas emissions reduction
                            commitments,
                            and others.</li>
                        <li>Analysis of renewable energy legislation and promotion, especially with respect to biogas.
                        </li>
                        <li>Analysis of legislation dealing with wastewater, solid wastes, agricultural wastes and
                            related
                            topics.</li>
                        <li>Analysis of existing distribution of responsibilities and powers of state bodies related to
                            the coordination of the biogas industry and the identification of gaps.</li>
                        <li>Review of existing tools and mechanisms that the state has to stimulate and promote recovery
                            and utilization of biogas.</li>
                        <li>Review of international experiences in the regulation and promotion of biogas.</li>
                        <li>Development of a series of action plans and responsibilities of stakeholders to detail and
                            implement them.</li>

                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>The Action Plans and other results of the roadmap effort will be presented at the Water Expo Central
                    Asia 2019, providing participants the opportunity to consult with decision-makers and stakeholders
                    on the activities recommended.</p>
                <p>The Department of Renewable Energy is working with a broad range of stakeholders throughout the
                    related sectors in Kazakhstan. This includes other ministries, such as Industry, Agriculture and
                    Finance; wastewater management agencies; NGOs promoting renewable energy and biogas; academia; and
                    the private sector. International development agencies also are kept apprised of this work.</p>
                <p>There will be pre-feasibility studies in two selected wastewater plants, most likely in Nur-Sultan
                    and Taldykorgan. Other activities, such as the Stakeholders Meeting and the Technical Training, will
                    be organized at the national level.</p>

                <h4>Expected Outcomes</h4>
                <p>Development of a roadmap that will identify and prioritize concrete actions to promote legal and
                    regulatory support for biogas use in Kazakhstan.</p>
                <p>Preparation and distribution of a report that will document the results of the technical and
                    economic prefeasibility studies; the report will focus on the technologies and costs of methane
                    capture and utilization at two representative WWTPs in Kazakhstan.</p>
                <p>Improving in-country capacity in biogas based on participation of WWTP operators and other
                    stakeholders
                    in a technical training workshop. Participants will gain knowledge about the techniques and
                    technologies
                    for biogas recovery, and preliminary costs for such designs, which will increase the likelihood of
                    biogas use from WWTP.</p>
                <p>Increased awareness of the potential for biogas use from WWTPs by sharing technical expertise at a
                    meeting of high-level decision-makers to review existing knowledge and activities in biogas
                    production
                    and utilization, and present current efforts in the municipal wastewater sector.</p>
