                    In Mexico, government agencies with jurisdiction and responsibility in wastewater treatment are
                    collaborating with the Global Methane Initiative (GMI) at three different levels to reduce methane
                    emissions from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) including: 1) Federal level, the Ministry of
                    Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT) and BANOBRAS, the local infrastructure development
                    bank; 2) state level as each state has its own Water Commission; and 3) municipal level because the
                    municipalities operate WWTPs. The objective of this collaboration is to analyze the potential for
                    biogas recovery and utilization in the municipal wastewater treatment sector. This work includes
                    technical analyses, benchmarking against international norms and best practices, identification of
                    the cost-effectiveness of biogas recovery, developing policy recommendations, promoting financing of
                    infrastructure required, and supporting technical training of WWTP operators.
                </p>

                        In support of this effort, the following actions are being undertaken in 2019:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Executive Meeting:</strong> The convening of a half-day meeting of high-level
                        decision-makers to review existing knowledge and activities in wastewater biogas production and
                        utilization and present current efforts in the municipal wastewater sector. International
                        experiences will be presented to contribute to a better understanding of what may be possible in
                        Mexico. Financing opportunities also will be presented. This meeting will take place in Mexico
                        City on 8 May 2019.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Prefeasibility Studies:</strong> A technical team from Mexico and GMI will carry out
                        technical and economic pre-feasibility studies at two selected wastewater treatment plants
                        representative of the WWTP sector in Mexico. Work has started at the Monclova WWTP in Coahuila
                        and the Atapaneo plant near Morelia, Michoacan, focusing on the technologies and costs of
                        methane capture and utilization. In addition, a desk study will be prepared to support current
                        efforts by the Naucalpan WWTP in Mexico to incorporate biogas capture into their WWTP
                        rehabilitation plans. Results will be presented at each plant, and incorporated into the
                        Technical Training Workshop described below.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Technical Training Workshop:</strong> A workshop for WWTP operators will focus on the
                        techniques and technologies for biogas recovery, and preliminary costs for such designs. The
                        workshop will be based on international best practices in the context of the WWTP sector in
                        Mexico, and will include the results of the pre-feasibility studies and the desk study described
                        above. Calculation exercises will assist in underlining key technical parameters. Project
                        financing opportunities also will be presented. The <a

                    Representatives at three levels of government (federal, state and municipal) are collaborating with
                    GMI, as well as NGOs promoting renewable energy and biogas, academia, and the private sector.
                </p>
                <h4>Expected Outcomes</h4>
                <p>Preparation and distribution of a report that will document the results of the technical and economic
                    pre-feasibility studies; the report will focus on the technologies and costs of methane capture and
                    utilization at two representative WWTPs in Mexico.</p>
                <p>Building in-country capacity in biogas based on participation of WWTP operators and other
                    stakeholders
                    in a technical training workshop. Participants will gain knowledge about the techniques and
                    technologies
                    for biogas recovery, and preliminary costs for such designs, which will increase the likelihood of
                    biogas use from WWTPs.</p>
                <p>Increased awareness of the potential for biogas use from WWTPs by sharing technical expertise at an
                    executive meeting of high-level decision-makers to review existing financing opportunities,
                    technical
                    knowledge and activities in biogas production and utilization, and present current efforts in the
                    municipal wastewater sector.</p>
