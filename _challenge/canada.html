                        <h3>Regulations Respecting Reduction in the Release of Methane and Certain Volatile Organic
                            Compounds (Upstream Oil and Gas Sector) </h3>
                        <p><img src="images/canada/methaneregscanada.png" style="max-width:200px; float:right;">The oil
                            and gas sector is the largest industrial emitter of methane in Canada, releasing
                            almost half of total methane emissions from industrial sources. </p>

                        <p>Beginning in spring 2018, new federal regulations restricted methane emissions from upstream
                            activities such as exploration, drilling, production, processing and transmission of oil
                            and
                            gas from facilities that handle significant volumes of gas. They cover specific methane
                            emissions sources including fugitive emissions and venting from specific equipment and from
                            facilities generally. Stakeholders for this effort include indigenous peoples; provincial,
                            territorial and municipal governments; industry; and non-governmental organizations.</p>
                        <h4>How Canada is Measuring Effectiveness</h4>
                        <p>Reductions of methane emissions from the oil and gas sector are tracked in the national
                            greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory. Industry actions will also be reviewed through ongoing
                            reporting requirements in the regulations.</p>
                        <h4>Expected Outcomes</h4>
                        <p>Reducing methane is recognized as one of the lowest cost opportunities to make significant
                            GHG
                            reductions from the energy sector. The federal methane regulations for the oil and gas
                            sector
                            have been designed to achieve Canada's target of reducing emissions of methane from oil and
                            gas
                            operations by 40 – 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025. The regulations will result in
                            tangible
                            reductions of 20 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent between 2018 and 2035, which is
                            equal
                            to taking about 5 million passenger vehicles off the road each year.

                            decomposition of organics in landfills is a major source of methane in Canada.
                            When organics are buried in a landfill they can emit methane for up to 50 years. These
                            emissions can be avoided by diverting organics to other waste management activities (such
                            as composting) and by preventing the generation of unnecessary organic waste. Environment
                            and Climate Change Canada is doing extensive work to provide information to provincial and
                            municipal organization on the waste disposal options available for organics. ECCC is also
                            raising awareness of food waste as a contributor to methane generation, and it is
                            developing
                            strategies to encourage reductions in food waste across the food distribution network.
                            Collaboration
                            among the provinces, municipalities, and the public will be key components of this effort.

                                style="float:right; margin-left:6px; max-width:200px;">Landfilling
                            is the most common waste disposal method in Canada. Landfills are a major
                            source of methane nationally. While diverting organics from landfills will help mitigate
                            future methane emissions, organics that have already been disposed of in landfills will
                            continue to emit large amounts of methane over the next 20-50 years. Current landfill gas
                            (LFG) capture practices mitigate up to 50% of generated methane in landfills, however
                            opportunity exists to reduce emissions by increasing the amount of LFG capture. Environment
                            and Climate Change Canada is working to encourage greater LFG collection across provinces
                            and municipalities through feasibility studies of LFG capture in small, medium and large
                            landfills. This work includes developing a comprehensive landfill database, LFG modelling,
                            assessment of existing technologies, and cost-per-tonne asessments.

                            Unconventional Oil and Gas Processing</h3>
                        <p><img src="images/canada/flarenet.png" style="float:right;">FlareNet is an NSERC Strategic
                            Network with an objective to provide a quantitative understanding of flare generated
                            pollutant emissions critical to enabling science-based policy, accurate pollutant
                            inventories, understanding of climate forcing and health implications, and engineering
                            design and assessment of mitigation strategies to minimize environmental impacts in the
                            energy sector. </p>
                        <p>Flaring is the most commonly deployed approach to reduce methane emissions from gaseous
                            waste streams. Recently published work in FlareNet (Tyner & Johnson, EST, 2018), has also
                            shown that flaring and incineration are likely to increase significantly as new methane
                            regulations are implemented. Since the start of serious discussion of methane regulations
                            from 2016-2018, reported flaring is trending up at (oil/bitumen/gas batteries, gas
                            gathering systems and gas plants) with a year over year increase of 8 percent.</p>
                        <p>Quantitative understanding of flare generated pollutant emissions are thus critical for
                            informing appropriate mitigation actions and understanding implications, including impacts
                            of policy and regulatory decisions. This is a key goal of FlareNet.</p>

                        <p><img src="images/canada/nserc.jpg" style="float:left;">The FlareNet Network is a 5-year
                            $6.9M project funded by NSERC ($5.5M over 5 years) with contributions from government
                            agencies, industry and Canadian universities (NRCan contribution includes $835,000 and
                            in-kind support). The Network integrates a diverse group of researchers working on research
                            challenges through collaborative large-scale experiments backed by field measurements. </p>

                        <p>Experiments occur at two main research facilities — the Carleton University

                            emissions.</p>
                        <p>The University of Saskatchewan research team is investigating how to improve the
                            nutritional value of grazed forages and the impact of non-bloat legume pastures on enteric
                            methane production.</p>
                        <p>The University of Lethbridge is investigating the impact of adding biochar to feedlot beef
                            cattle diets on GHG emissions from enteric fermentation and manure management.

                        <h4>How Canada is Measuring Effectiveness</h4>
                        <p>Effectiveness is measured by how the results of the four research teams can be applied to
                            promote sustainable agricultural production and mitigation information and technologies.</p>
                        <h4>Expected Outcomes</h4>
                        <p>Canada aims to promote sustainability of agricultural production in Canada and make
                            Greenhouse Gas mitigation information and technologies available to farmers. </p>

                        <h3>Agricultural Greenhouse Gases Program</h3>
                        <p>In 2016, Canada create the Agricultural Greenhouse Gases Program (AGGP). The goal of this
                            five-year (2016-2021) program aims to enhance the understanding and accessibility of
                            agricultural technologies, beneficial management practices (BMPs) and processes that can be
                            adopted by farmers to mitigate agricultural greenhouse (GHGs) emissions in Canada.</p>
                        <p>The AGGP aims to support initiatives that have the potential to lead the way to broader
                            adoption or application of BMPs on farm and by the sector more generally. The program also
                            aims to support efforts to understand the potential impacts of GHGs as well as approaches
                            to mitigate agricultural GHG emissions. The AGGP hopes this information will result in
                            better strategies for climate change adaptation across the agricultural sector.</p>
                        <p>The AGGP ultimately contribute to the mitigation of GHG emissions and other positive
                            longer-term environmental impacts for Canada, which in turn supports the Government of
                            Canada’s commitments to the environment and climate change.</p>

                        <h4>How Canada is Measuring Effectiveness</h4>
                        <p>Effectiveness is measured by GHG emission reductions that may be reflected in Canada's
                            National Inventory Report (NIR) of greenhouse gases. </p>
