          <h2>Punjab Agriculture Management &amp; Extension Training Institute, Curbing emissions by advocating no-burn agriculture</h2>
          <p>The action is being taken in the adopted villages of Sangrur and Amritsar district, India. The villages adopted in Sangrur district are Uppli, Tungaan and Kanoi; whereas the villages adopted in Amritsar district are Rajjian, Bhoewali and Qiampur. The villages are provided with straw management equipment such as Happy Seeder, PAU Straw-Cutter-cum-Spreader and a Mould Board Plough. The objective of providing the machinery is to encourage the farmers to use these machines to manage the rice residue, instead of burning the straw in the open.</p>
          
          <p><i>Partners: </i>PAMETI is working with UNEP and CCAC to provide the adopted villages with straw management equipment such as Happy Seeder, PAU Straw Cutter-cum-Spreader and a Mould Board Plough. </p>
          <h3>Measuring Effectiveness</h3>
          <p>The success depends on the realization of good yield by the farmers. So far so, during the wheat harvesting season (April -2019), the yields look promising and the account of farmers getting good yield is being regularly documented and the farmers are applauded for the same by giving them a commendation. </p>
          <h3>Expected Outcomes</h3>
          <p>The progress is and has been measured by the amount of area managed by the straw managing equipment such as Happy Seeder. During the last year, a total of 1025 acres (415 hectares) was managed i.e. wheat was sown in the standing rice stubble. Farmers usually burnt this area owing to non-availability of machines but the project interventions took care of the same. Record maintenance is done periodically on the area under paddy being managed by the machines.</p>
          <h3>Methane Reductions</h3>
          <p>Based on the area covered by rice residue management machinery during the year 2018, it is expected that the emission reductions would be around 4 tonnes of Methane, 2400 tonnes of Carbon-di-Oxide, 6 tonnes of Nitrous-di-Oxide, 150 tonnes of Carbon Monoxide and 0.5 tonnes of Sulphur-di-Oxide.</p>
