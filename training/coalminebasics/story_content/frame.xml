      <slidetext slideid="6MpSPVyVB6V.6SmRTabEjgy" slidebank="false" type="slide"> welcome this training was developed by united states environmental protection agency (usepa) in support of voluntary activities to reduce methane emissions under the coalbed methane outreach program (cmop) and the global methane initiative (gmi). what is the gmi? you will learn about the following topics in this course: why is there methane in coal? what are the primary methods of extracting coal? what are the characteristics of methane emissions from coal mines, otherwise known as coal mine methane (cmm)? how is methane captured using mine ventilation and gas drainage? what are the beneficial uses of captured methane?</slidetext>
      <slidetext slideid="6MpSPVyVB6V.5fMwUARbQYZ" slidebank="false" type="slide"> why is methane important? methane is a potent greenhouse gas (ghg). it is the second most abundant ghg behind carbon dioxide (co2):  global warming potential: 28-36 times that of co2 over 100 years atmospheric lifetime: 12 years  methane is a well-mixed gas in the atmosphere. reductions anywhere in the world impact global concentrations.   methane in mines also poses a safety risk due to its explosiveness when mixed with air in concentrations between 5% and 17%. global projections for 2030 projected global methane emissions from coal mining are estimated to reach 911 million metric tons co2 equivalent (mmtco2e) in 2030, which is about 10% of global anthropogenic methane emissions.</slidetext>

  <transcript_data />
  <glossary_data>
    <terms>
      <term title="Abandoned Mine Methane (AMM)">Coal mines that are temporarily or permanently closed that produce significant methane emissions from diffuse vents, fissures, or boreholes. </term>
      <term title="Adsorbed Methane">Methane accumulated on the surface of coal.</term>
      <term title="Borehole">A narrow shaft bored in the ground, either vertically or horizontally.</term>
      <term title="Coal Bed Methane (CBM)">Methane extracted from coal seams before mining occurs. CBM is also known as virgin coal seam methane or coal seam gas. It is widely considered an "unconventional" source of natural gas.</term>
      <term title="Coal Mine Methane (CMM)">Methane released from coal due to mining activities. Like CBM, CMM is a subset of the methane found in coal seams, but it refers specifically to the methane found within mining areas (e.g., within a mining plan), while CBM refers to methane in coal seams that will never be mined. Because CMM would be released through mining activities, recovering and using CMM is considered emissions avoidance.</term>
      <term title="Compressed Natural Gas (CNG)">Natural gas mainly comprised of methane that is stored under high pressures, mainly as a means for storage or transportation.</term>
      <term title="Desk Study">A first order analysis based on limited data, basic assumptions, and simple financial modeling.</term>
      <term title="Direct Thermal">The use of coal mine methane in direct combustion technologies other than flaring, most commonly in boilers, industrial burners, and similar applications.</term>
      <term title="Drainage Galleries">Existing roadways or purpose-driven roadways above or below the mined seam that collect methane from gob areas. The galleries are sealed, and vacuum pressure is applied to draw the gas from the galleries into the pipeline system. These are also sometimes referred to as superjacent boreholes. </term>
      <term title="Evase">The discharge point of surface exhaust fans. The evase is used to direct the exhausted air safely away from the mine.</term>
      <term title="Feasibility Studies">Thorough report investigating the economic and technical feasibility of project development. This document is considered “bankable”, meaning it is sufficient to secure project financing.</term>
      <term title="Flaring">Controlled combustion of natural gas. Flaring CMM at a coal mine can occur in an open flame, otherwise known as a candlestick flare, or in an enclosed flare, sometimes referred to as a ground flare.  </term>
      <term title="Gas Content">Volume of gas contained in a unit mass of coal and is generally expressed in cubic meters, at standard pressure and temperature conditions, per ton of coal.</term>
      <term title="Gas Drainage">Methods employed by underground coal mines, abandoned mines, and occasionally surface mines, for capturing the naturally occurring gas in coal seams to prevent it entering mine airways. Gas drainage systems include a combination of drainage boreholes and/or galleries, a gathering network, and vacuum pumps to draw gas to the surface. Gas can be removed from coal seams in advance of mining using pre‐drainage techniques and from coal seams disturbed by the extraction process using post‐drainage techniques. It is often referred to as methane drainage if methane is the main gas component target to be captured. Gas drainage produces coal mine methane of a higher quality than ventilation, generally in the 25 — 100 percent range.</term>
      <term title="Gas Gathering System">A system of pipelines, moisture and dust removal equipment, and prime movers (e.g., vacuum pumps, compressors) that transport gas from borehole wellheads to the surface. </term>
      <term title="Global Methane Initiative (GMI)">Launched in 2004, the GMI is an international public-private initiative that advances cost-effective, near-term methane abatement and recovery and use of methane as a clean energy source in three sectors: biogas (including agriculture, municipal solid waste, and wastewater), coal mines, and oil and gas systems. Focusing collective efforts on methane emission sources is a cost-effective approach to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increase energy security, enhance economic growth, improve air quality and improve worker safety.</term>
      <term title="Gob (Goaf)">Broken, permeable ground where coal has been extracted by longwall coal mining and the roof has been allowed to collapse, thus fracturing and de-stressing strata above and, to a lesser extent, below the seam being worked. The term gob is generally used in the United States; elsewhere, goaf is generally used.</term>
      <term title="Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG)">The release of greenhouse gases and/or their precursors into the atmosphere over a specified area and period of time. May be labelled as anthropogenic (resulting from human activities) or naturally occurring.</term>
      <term title="Longwall">One of three major underground coal mining methods currently in use. Employs a shearer which is pulled mechanically back and forth across a face of coal that is usually several hundred feet long. This mining method can produce large quantities of coal and gas.</term>
      <term title="Longwall Face">The end of the longwall panel that is being cut by the longwall shearer. </term>
      <term title="Longwall Panel">Large blocks of coal that are mined with a longwall shearer.    </term>
      <term title="Methane">Methane is a potent greenhouse gas. Methane's lifetime in the atmosphere is much shorter than carbon dioxide, but it is 28 times as efficient at trapping radiation than CO2 over a 100-year period. Methane is the main precursor of ground level ozone pollution, and thus affects air quality. Methane is also an energy resource that can be captured and used. Methane in mines poses safety risks, due to its explosiveness when mixed with air.</term>
      <term title="Permeability">The state or quality of a material or membrane that causes it to allow liquids or gases to pass through it.</term>
      <term title="Post-Mine Drainage">Drilling boreholes (vertical gob wells, cross-measure boreholes, directional horizontal boreholes, or gob drainage galleries) in advance of mining so that they are in place prior to under-mining but producing gas during and after the seam is being mined. </term>
      <term title="Post-Mine Drainage Boreholes">Boreholes drilled above or below the mined seam which produce methane from gob areas after the coal seam is mined. Post-mine drainage boreholes can be drilled from the surface or in-mine. Initially, methane concentrations can be high, but concentrations will decline relatively quickly as air from the gob area is drawn into the boreholes. There are also commonly referred to as post-drainage boreholes.</term>
      <term title="Pre-Feasibility Studies">Typically provide a detailed technical analysis of site-specific information and considers project financing. Provides a gas production forecast and a review of current gas drainage practices. However, this document provides less granularity than a full feasibility study. This document is typically not considered a “bankable” document.</term>
      <term title="Pre-Mine Drainage">Drilling in-seam boreholes to extract gas from the coal seam in advance of mining operations. </term>
      <term title="Pre-Mine Drainage Boreholes">Boreholes drilled into the mined seam or adjacent gas-bearing rock and coal strata in advance of mining to remove methane before mining occurs. Pre-mine drainage boreholes can be drilled from the surface or in-mine. Gas is produced in the boreholes before the coal seam is mined. Once mined-through, gas production ceases. Methane concentrations can be very high, and boreholes can produce gas for many years in advance of mining. These are also commonly referred to as pre-drainage boreholes. </term>
      <term title="Rank">The classification of coals according to their degree of metamorphism, progressive alteration, or coalification (maturation) in the natural series from lignite to anthracite.</term>
      <term title="Room and Pillar Mining">Coal deposits are mined by cutting a network of rooms into the coal seam and leaving the pillars of coal to support the roof of the mine. These pillars can comprise up to 40% of the total coal in the seam. The remaining pillars can sometimes be recovered at a later stage. Room and pillar mines account for a smaller share of the world’s underground coal production.</term>
      <term title="Strata">A layer of sedimentary rock or soil; refers to a layer of coal in this instance.</term>
      <term title="Surface Mining">A form of mining that is generally used when coal seams are less than 60 meters (approximately 200 feet) from the surface. There are two primary types of surface mines: strip mines and open-pit mines. Strip mining consists of the removal of soil and rock (overburden) above a layer or seam (particularly coal), followed by the removal of the exposed mineral. is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth from an open-air pit, sometimes known as a borrow. This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunnelling into the earth, such as long wall mining. It is applied to ore or rocks found at the surface because the overburden is relatively thin, or the material of interest is structurally unsuitable for tunnelling.</term>
      <term title="Town Gas">Manufactured gaseous fuel produced for sale to consumers and municipalities. Also referred to as coal gas.</term>
      <term title="United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)">The Environmental Protection Agency is an independent executive agency of the United States federal government tasked with environmental protection matters.</term>
      <term title="Ventilation Air Methane (VAM)">CMM that is removed via ventilation systems which use fans to dilute the methane to safe levels by circulating fresh air through the mine. VAM is the largest source of methane emissions from underground coal mines. </term>
