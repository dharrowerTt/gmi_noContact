<p>The Oil & Gas Subcommittee facilitates cooperative mitigation activities that result in bringing more gas to markets.  Subcommittee activities include encouraging collaboration among delegates from Partner Countries and Project Network members to build capacity, develop strategies and markets, and remove technical and non-technical barriers to oil and gas sector methane mitigation project development.</p>
