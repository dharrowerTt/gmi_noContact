<p>The Agriculture Technical Group is dedicated to reducing the impacts of climate change by providing international leadership to mitigate global methane emissions through the abatement, recovery, and use of methane from agricultural sources. The technical group promotes collaboration between delegates from Partner Countries and Project Network members to build capacity, develop strategies and markets, and remove barriers to methane mitigation project development in order to increase environmental quality, improve rural livelihoods, strengthen the economy, and expand opportunities for renewable energy production and use.</p>
