<p><strong>Methane is produced when the organic material in municipal wastewater decomposes anaerobically. Varying amounts of methane are emitted during the collection, handling, and treatment of wastewater depending on methods employed. A number of techniques can be employed to reduce or recover and use wastewater methane that can yield substantial energy, economic, environmental, air quality, and public health benefits.</strong></p>
<p>The Municipal Wastewater Technical Group, including experts from government and the private sector, provides international leadership to mitigate global methane emissions through the abatement, recovery, and use of methane from municipal wastewater sources. The technical group works to identify needs, opportunities and priorities for project development globally as well as key barriers and strategies to overcome them. 
    The technical group also facilitates investment and financing opportunities and other cooperative activities and projects that advance the abatement and recovery of methane and its use as an energy source.</p>
