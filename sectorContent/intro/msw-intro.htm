<p><strong>Municipal solid waste (MSW) management and treatment activities are sources of methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) emissions worldwide.</strong></p>

<p>There are opportunities to reduce CH<sub>4</sub> emissions by collecting the CH<sub>4</sub> containing landfill gas and using it to fuel boilers, engines, or other technologies. CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from MSW can also be reduced by modifying how the waste is treated. For example, organic fractions of the MSW stream can be diverted from landfills and instead disposed of at anaerobic digesters, composting facilities, or waste-to-energy facilities.Â Using these climate friendly MSW solutions can yield energy, economic, environmental, and public health benefits.</p>
