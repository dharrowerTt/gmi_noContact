<p>The GMI Coal Subcommittee fosters international collaboration to advance methane capture and use projects that bring more gas to market. Technical experts from government and the private sector participate in the subcommittee activities, which includes development of Action Plans. The plans identify the needs, opportunities and priorities for project development globally as well as key barriers and strategies to overcome them. The Coal Subcommittee also facilitates investment and financing opportunities and other cooperative activities.</p>
