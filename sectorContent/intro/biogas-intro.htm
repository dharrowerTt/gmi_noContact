<p><strong>There are common interests and similarities across the areas of agriculture, municipal solid waste, and municipal wastewater. </strong></p>

<p>The Biogas Subcommittee focuses on building capacity within Partner Countries to leverage the common interests across these areas, including biogas energy use, the types of wastes managed, waste treatment technologies, and the potential for synergistic projects involving input streams from multiple sources.  Efforts include developing and promoting tools, policy guidance, and project development resources at the national, state, and city level within Partner Countries.</p>

        <p style="margin-left:5%;">Methane is produced when the organic material in municipal wastewater decomposes anaerobically. Varying amounts of methane are emitted during the collection, handling, and treatment of wastewater depending on methods employed. A number of techniques can be employed to reduce or recover and use wastewater methane that can yield substantial energy, economic, environmental, air quality, and public health benefits. <a href="technicalgroup.aspx?s=ww" class="lightlink">Learn more from the Wastewater technical group page</a>.</p>
