        Biogas Fact Sheet: Reducing Emissions, Advancing Recovery and Use</h3>
    <p>
        The Biogas sector presents a new fact sheet, available <a href="/documents/GMI_Biogoas_Factsheet.pdf">
            here.</a> (PDF, 4pp, 1.1MB)</p>

    <p>Prepared by the Wilson’s Center China Environment Forum with assistance provided by GMI, the report highlights food waste trends in Chinese cities and assesses the possibilities of redirecting food waste to municipal wastewater (MWW) and sludge-to-energy (StE) plants. This report also highlights some specific gaps that GMI and other organizations could help fill and potential Chinese partners to engage with to highlight the environmental and economic benefits of co-digestion.</p>

    <p>In March 2017, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency – as a lead partner in the Waste Initiative – conducted a waste characterization study at the municipality’s transfer station. The study indicated that approximately 69% of the waste handled at the transfer station could be recycled or otherwise diverted from the landfill, and that more than half of the waste could be used as feedstock in composting or anaerobic digestion projects. The municipality is using the results of the study to inform decision making about the project design and procurement options.</p>

    <p>The Wilson Center’s China Environment Forum (CEF) produced this sludge scoping report for the U.S. EPA and the Global Methane Initiative. The report describes drivers that created mountains of municipal sludge, introduces key political and research entities involved in sludge regulation in China, reviews obstacles in adoption of anaerobic digestion, provides a case study of the challenges facing sludge-to-energy projects, and highlights opportunities for U.S. government, cities, and companies to engage with Chinese government agencies.</p>

        aims to help local decision makers in their first evaluation of different treatment
        options (e.g., composting options and/or anaerobic digestion options). OrganEcs
        helps users determine the economic feasibility of waste management scenarios by
        calculating tipping fees, sales of products (e.g., organic compost), and the internal
        rate of return. OrganEcs use requires expert support.</p>

        Excel tool created by the Waste Initiative. SWEET helps users scope emissions sources
        such as waste collection and transportation, open burning, landfill gas collection
        systems, organic waste management projects, waste handling equipment (e.g., bulldozers),
        and waste incineration facilities. It estimates waste sector emissions including
        methane, black carbon, and several other pollutants. It also evaluates emissions
        reduction benefits of multiple alternative waste management scenarios.</p>

        Biogas Wastewater Assessment Technology Tool (BioWATT)</h3>
    <p>
        Originally developed by the World Bank and enhanced by GMI, the <a href="/documents/BioWATT_v1-0_FINAL_5-11-16.xlsx">
            Biogas Wastewater Assessment Technology Tool (BioWATT)</a> (XLS, 1.8 MB) provides
        a quick and preliminary assessment of wastewater-to-energy projects.</p>
    <p>
        Based on simple inputs provided by the user, BioWATT provides the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Biogas production estimate for various wastewater-to-energy technologies</li>
        <li>Electricity generation potential from the produced biogas</li>
        <li>Greenhouse gas savings associated with biogas-generated electricity </li>
        <li>Preliminary assessment of the wastewater treatment facility’s electricity demand
            that can be met through biogas-generated electricity</li>
        <li>Preliminary design parameters of major components of a wastewater-to-energy project,
            such as required digester volume, required gas holder volume, and total combined
            heat and power (CHP) electric power output</li>
        <li>Impact on a wastewater treatment facility’s operating expenses (OPEX) by investing
            in energy generation technology</li>
    </ul>
