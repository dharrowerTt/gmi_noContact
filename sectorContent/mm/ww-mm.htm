<h3>
    Meeting Minutes</h3>
<p>
    The GMI Municipal Wastewater Subcommittee is dedicated to reducing the impacts of
    climate change by providing international leadership to mitigate global methane
    emissions through the abatement, recovery, and use of methane from municipal wastewater
    sources. Technical experts from government and the private sector participate in
    the Subcommittees. Each subcommittee has developed a sector-specific Action Plan
    that identifies the needs, opportunities and priorities for project development
    globally as well as key barriers and strategies to overcome them. The technical
    subcommittees also facilitate investment and financing opportunities and other cooperative
    activities and projects that advance the abatement and recovery of methane and its
    use as an energy source.</p>
