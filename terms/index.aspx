				<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
							<p>To create a voluntary, non-binding framework for international cooperation to reduce methane emissions and to advance the recovery and use of methane as a valuable clean energy source to increase energy security, enhance economic growth, improve air quality, and improve industrial safety. The Initiative will focus on the abatement, recovery, and use of methane through technology demonstration, diffusion, implementation of effective policy frameworks, identification of ways and means to support investment, and removal of barriers to collaborative project development. The Initiative will serve to complement and support Partners' efforts implemented under the United Nations' Framework Convention on Climate Change.</p>
