							<p>GMI led the development of this resource on monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) of methane emissions from coal mining. The report, Best Practice Guidance for Effective Management of Coal Mine Methane at National Level: Monitoring, Reporting, Verification and Mitigation, was published jointed with the UNECE Group of Experts on Coal Mine Methane and Just Transition. The document aims to assist countries with designing national systems to quantify and report methane emissions from coal mines. National MRV programs have the potential to not only help countries better understand their emissions from coal mining, but also to identify opportunities for mitigation. In particular, MRV can help assess and track the effectiveness of adopted climate policies.</p>

								Global Methane Emissions from Coal Mining to Continue Growing Even with Declining Coal Production (2020)</a>
							</h4>
							<p>Coal mines are one of the largest sources of anthropogenic methane emissions. As the world produces more coal, coal mines get deeper every year, and methane emissions grow with increasing mining depth. Mine operators also abandon old coal mines, which still emit methane into the atmosphere. The U.S. EPA, in collaboration with the Global Methane Initiative and several other organizations, co-authored this paper that presents projections of global methane emissions from coal mining under different coal extraction scenarios and with increasing mining depth through 2100. The study estimates methane emissions from underground and surface coal production while accounting for the increase in mining depth using several new and compiled data sets. </p>
