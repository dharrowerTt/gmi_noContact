				<p>Interested governments may request to join the Global Methane Initiative at any time.</p>
				<p>To join, the lead ministry or agency should submit an e-mail of interest to the <a href="../asg.aspx">Administrative Support Group</a>. At a minimum, the letter should include the following information:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Primary contact's name, e-mail, and telephone and fax numbers.</li>
					<li>Reason for interest and the subcommittee(s) on which you plan to participate.</li>
					<li>A short description of the opportunities for methane projects and/or the type of expertise that your country can contribute.</li>
					<li>If appropriate, your interest and rationale for becoming a member of the Steering Committee.</li>
				</ol>
                <p>Countries may use this <a href="../documents/participate_letter_template.doc">suggested letter format</a> (DOC, 1 pp, 28 KB) to assist in drafting their letter to the Administrative Support Group.</p> 
				<p>The Administrative Support Group will circulate this letter to the members of the Initiative's Steering Committee for review. If no objections are received within 60 days, the application is automatically accepted. If there are objections, these will be resolved at the next scheduled meeting of the Steering Committee.</p> 
				<p>Upon completion of Steering Committee approval, new Partners formalize their membership by signing and returning the <a href="../about/terms.aspx">Terms of Reference</a>. The new Partner will then appoint representatives to technical subcommittees. Partners may appoint up to three representatives to subcommittees for which they have expertise or an interest in pursuing projects. The new Partner will also identify an &quot;Administrative Liaison&quot; to act as the central contact point for all GMI issues.</p> 
				<p>If a country has requested to join the Steering Committee, the Steering Committee will make a decision on this request at its next scheduled meeting.</p>
				<p>For more information about joining the GMI, please contact the <a href="../asg.aspx">Administrative Support Group.</a></p>
