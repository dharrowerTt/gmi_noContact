                  <p>
                     The U.S. EPA, in collaboration with The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) of India, released an analysis entitled, “Methane Mitigation: Lessons Learned from India’s Compressed Biogas Projects.” This report assesses facilities that mitigate methane emissions by generating compressed natural gas (CNG) from biogas feedstocks, such as livestock manure and agriculture waste, utilizing anaerobic digesters, in India. The report summarizes the developmental and operational challenges for such “Compressed BioGas (CBG)” plants, specifically focusing on the challenges and opportunities that stakeholders face in the development and operation of CBG plants. Recovering methane from agriculture and food waste and converting it to energy resources is critical to methane mitigation efforts in India and energy security in developing countries.

                  <p>
                     In 2024, the U.S. EPA, in collaboration with the Asian Development Bank and in support of the Global Methane Initiative (GMI) Biogas Subcommittee, hosted a four-part training series: Best Practices on Landfill and Organic Waste Management. The training focused on proven approaches and case studies for dumpsite closure and remediation; sanitary landfill construction, operation, and maintenance; organic waste treatment; feedstock management; greenhouse gas (GHG) measurement, reporting, and verification; and useful tools and resources. The training was initially delivered to implementers of the Bahawalpur Integrated Solid Waste Management project in Pakistan, but the training materials are broadly applicable to national and subnational decision-makers and policymakers, waste professionals, waste facility operators, and project developers.

                  <p>
                     Mitigating post-harvest food loss can result in economic benefits for farmers, increase food security, and reduce methane emissions from organic waste. An estimated 30 percent of food produced in India is lost or wasted, despite the country ranking 94th out of 100 on the 2020 Global Hunger Index (Bagai, 2020). Almost half of post-harvest food losses in India are attributed to the lack of a reliable cold chain, the integrated network of refrigerated storage facilities, transportation, and merchandising technologies that maintain food quality moving from harvest to the consumer (Peters et al., 2019). Cold-chain technologies are energy intensive and typically powered by fossil fuels. In recent years, there has been a focus on clean energy powered cold-chain solutions, including renewable energy powered cold storage facilities that store commodities immediately after harvest.
