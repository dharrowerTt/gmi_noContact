                    The GMI Biogas Subcommittee focuses on building capacity within Partner Countries to leverage common interests across the areas of agriculture, municipal solid waste, and municipal wastewater. These interests include biogas energy use, the types of wastes managed, waste treatment technologies, and the potential for synergistic projects involving input streams from multiple sources. Efforts include developing and promoting tools, policy guidance, and project development resources at the national, state, and city level within Partner Countries.

                <h3>GMI Technical Groups</h3>
                <p>
                    Within the Biogas Sector, GMI maintains active technical groups in the areas of agriculture, municipal solid waste (MSW), and municipal wastewater.
                    These groups provide international leadership to mitigate global methane emissions through the abatement, recovery, and use of methane.
                    They promote collaboration between delegates from Partner Countries and Project Network members to build capacity, develop strategies, and expand opportunities for using methane as a renewable energy resource.

                    <strong>Biogas Webinar Series: Unlocking the Full Value of Anaerobic Digestion</strong><br>
                    Make plans to participate in the GMI Biogas Subcommittee webinar series. Participants will explore a variety of topics associated with different aspects of anaerobic digestion and collaborate with Subcommittee and Project Network members. The webinars, which are expected to begin in the coming months, will run for approximately 1.5 hours. Each webinar will include time for questions-and-answers and participants will have the opportunity to provide feedback during and after the webinar.
