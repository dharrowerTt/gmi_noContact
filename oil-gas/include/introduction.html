                        The GMI Oil & Gas Subcommittee focuses on identifying and deploying practical and cost-effective methane mitigation technologies and practices. The Subcommitteeâ€™s objective is to reduce or eliminate emissions from oil and natural gas systems by encouraging collaboration between Partner Countries, Subcommittee members, and Project Network members. Through engagement, the Subcommittee aims to build capacity, develop strategies and markets, and remove technical and nontechnical barriers to methane mitigation project development. Ultimately, this support can increase environmental quality, improve operational efficiency, and strengthen the economy from additional methane brought to market.
