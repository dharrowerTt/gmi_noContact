								A Technical, Economic and Environmental Analysis of Beneficial Use of Stranded Associated Gas in Kazakhstan (2023)</a>
							</h4>
							<p>GMI, with support from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), worked with a partner in Kazakhstan to obtain data on associated gas availability and content to assess the opportunity to mitigate methane and reduce flaring at the Mangystau oilfield in southwest Kazakhstan. The prefeasibility study investigated the potential to monetize the stranded associated gas in the Mangystau oilfield by utilizing modular, small-scale processing technologies to produce marketable liquid hydrocarbon commodities such as methanol, syn-diesel, oil, or others. The report includes the results of the prefeasibility assessment of the range of practical mitigation options and recommendations for an optimum solution.</p>

								Identifying and Evaluating Opportunities for Greenhouse Gas Mitigation & Operational Efficiency Improvement at Oil and Gas Facilities (2020)</a>
							</h4>
							<p>This document presents introductory guidance on a pragmatic, integrated approach to identifying, evaluating, and advancing cost-effective, high-impact opportunities to manage greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy use at oil and natural gas facilities. The focus is primarily on key sources of short-lived climate pollutants (SLCP).
							The primary audience for this document includes company managers, facility operators, and relevant service providers outside of North America (particularly where other regulatory guidance for GHG reductions and energy management may not be available).</p>
