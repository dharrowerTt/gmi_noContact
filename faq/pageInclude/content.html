                        <p>GMI is an international public-private partnership focused on reducing barriers to the recovery and use of methane as a clean energy source. The initiative provides technical support to deploy methane-to-energy projects around the world as well as information resources through its extensive online library featuring best practices, technical tools and resources, and more.</p>

                        <p>To support this effort, GMI collaborates with its <a href="/partners/index.aspx">Partner Countries</a> and more than 700 <a href="/project-network/index.aspx"> Project Network</a> members to exchange information and technical resources to advance methane mitigation in three key sectors: <a href="/oil-gas/index.aspx">Oil & Gas</a>, <a href="/biogas/index.aspx">Biogas</a>, and <a href="/coal/index.aspx">Coal Mines</a>.</p>

                        <p>Additionally, GMI works with other international organizations focused on methane recovery and use, including the <a href="https://ccacoalition.org/en" target="_blank">Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC)</a>, the <a href="https://www.unece.org/info/ece-homepage.html" target="_blank">United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE)</a>, and the <a href="https://www.iea.org/">Energy Agency (IEA)</a>.</p>

                <img src="gmiMap.png" style="float:right;width:50%;" />
                <p>GMI includes 45 <a href="/partners/index.aspx">Partner Countries</a>, which together represent approximately 75 percent of the world's estimated man-made methane emissions.</p>
                <p>Representatives of national governments with an interest in promoting methane projects can request to <a href="/join-gmi/index.aspx">join GMI</a> at any time.</p>

                <h3 id="q3">What are the commitments of Partner Countries?</h3>
                <p>Participating countries sign the <a href="/terms/index.aspx">Terms of Reference</a>, which outlines the purpose, <a href="/about/index.aspx">organizational structure</a>, and functions of GMI. This document also outlines more specific activities to be undertaken by GMI, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identify cost-effective opportunities to recover methane emissions for energy production.</li>
                    <li>Address barriers to project development (e.g., legal, regulatory, financial, institutional).</li>
                    <li>Foster cooperation among Partner Countries, the private sector, and other organizations.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>All Partners are also encouraged to develop GMI Partner Action Plans using the <a href="https://www.globalmethane.org/documents/GMI_RevisedActionPlanningGuidance_June2013.pdf">Action Planning guidance</a> (2013, PDF, 7 pp, 191 KB). Partner Action Plans identify the overall vision for a Partner's participation in GMI, outline key country activities and priorities, and provide a mechanism to advance cooperation among Partners by identifying needs and opportunities. The GMI Steering Committee asks that Partners submit their plans to the Administrative Support Group for posting.</p>

                <p><img src="pndonut.png" style="width:40%; float:right;margin-left:20px;margin-top:10px;">Yes! Active involvement by private sector entities, financial institutions, and other non-governmental organizations is essential to build capacity, transfer technology, and promote private investment. GMI's <a href="/project-network/index.aspx">Project Network</a> connects organizations with similar objectives to exchange information and encourages collaboration and communication among Project Network Members.</p>



                <h3 id="q5">What is the difference between a Partner and a Project Network member?</h3>
                <p>Partners are countries whose national governments sign the <a href="/terms/index.aspx">Terms of Reference</a> document. Partners appoint delegates to represent their government on each subcommittee for the key sectors (i.e., <a href="/oil-gas/index.aspx">Oil & Gas</a>, <a href="/biogas/index.aspx">Biogas</a>, and <a href="/coal/index.aspx">Coal Mines</a>) in which they have an interest. Partners may also have representatives on the <a href="/steering/index.aspx">Steering Committee</a>.</p>
                <p>The <a href="/project-network/index.aspx">Project Network </a>links organizations together to advance methane mitigation through communication, project development and implementation, and private-sector involvement. Members include private-sector companies, energy end users, local government organizations, research programs, financial institutions, and other non-governmental organizations. Project Network members are encouraged to attend subcommittee meetings, technical workshops, and other knowledge-sharing events.</p>

                <p>GMI provides technical support to deploy methane-to-energy projects around the world. Since 2004, GMI support has enabled Partner Countries to launch hundreds of methane recovery and use projects.</p>
                <p>GMI is an information resource for Partner Countries, Project Network members, and other stakeholders. GMI’s website serves as an online library with extensive information on methane-to-energy projects, best practices, and technical tools and resources. GMI also supports <a href="/events/index.aspx">meetings, webinars, and workshops,</a> technology transfer and other training events, feasibility studies, and other forms of technical assistance.</p>
                <p>GMI collaborates with other international organizations focused on methane recovery and use, including the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC), the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), and the International Energy Agency (IEA).</p>

                <h3 id="q9">What are the benefits of methane emission reductions?</h3>
                <p>Methane is a potent greenhouse gas. Over its 12-year lifetime in the atmosphere, it traps 28 times more heat than carbon dioxide, resulting in a stronger influence on warming. Methane’s short atmospheric lifetime also means that reductions today can make an immediate impact to slow warming. These reductions result in many benefits including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Decreased greenhouse gases</li>
                    <li>Better air and water quality</li>
                    <li>Improved human health</li>
                    <li>Increased worker safety</li>

                <p>GMI is a complementary initiative to a country's commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). GMI helps countries build capacity and provides technical support to advance methane mitigation projects to help advance their efforts under the UNFCCC.</p>
