					  <div class="text"><p><strong><a href="http://www.asianamericangas.com">Asian American Gas, Inc.:</a></strong> Asian American Gas Inc. (AAGI) is a young, energetic and fast-growing American company backed by world-renowned energy investment funds and mining companies. AAGI is primarily engaged in the exploration, development and production of coal bed methane (CBM) in China. Barely one year old, but being comprised of a group of people with more than a decade of experience in coal bed methane (CBM) exploration and development in China, AAGI has already established itself as one of the top foreign coal bed methane operators in China.</p>
					  <p>During the past decade, AAGI has developed the most advanced multi-lateral drilling (MLD) technology in China. In 2004, China's first coal bed methane MLD well was successfully planned, drilled, tested and completed by AAGI, with a record daily production rate up until now. This is not only a milestone for AAGI, but also an unforgettable page in China's CBM industry development.</p>
					  <p>AAGI currently holds two CBM concessions in the Shanxi Qinshui basin: Panzhuang block and Mabi block, which are about 150km2 and 1370km2 respectively. The proven reserve for Panzhuang block is 20.4 billion cubic meters (bcm), and it is one of only three blocks in China that has obtained government CBM reserve certification. The Mabi block holds a total gas in-place reserve of 3.5 trillion cubic feet (tcf) based on a preliminary evaluation. The accumulated investment volume that AAGI has put on CBM has exceeded over USD 80 million.</p>
					  <p>Up to now, the total output for the six gas wells has reached 300,000 m<sup>3</sup>/day, and the highest gas output for a single well has reached 94,000m<sup>3</sup>/day.</p>
					  <p>Recently, the Coalbed Methane Resources Development Plan in Panzhuang, owned by AAGI and its Chinese cooperative partners, has been approved by the Energy Bureau of The National Development and Reform Commission. AAGI is the first foreign company to obtain NDRC's approval for CBM commercial development in the last twenty years, and hopefully make the Panzhuang project the first CBM commercial development project. This also shows the great importance that the Chinese government attaches to CBM. AAGI will work with all its cooperative partners, utilizing advanced CBM technology, and make contributions to the development of clean energy and integrated development of de-gassing and coal mining.</p>

With 2006 sales and revenues of $41.517 billion, Caterpillar is the world's leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines and industrial gas turbines. The company also is a leading services provider through Caterpillar Financial Services, Caterpillar Remanufacturing Services, Caterpillar Logistics Services and Progress Rail Services.</p>
					  <p>The sustainability of our world and the sustainability of our business are inseparable. We work to provide solutions that make our customers' businesses more viable.  Caterpillar invested more than $2 billion over the last 10 years developing cleaner products, including ACERT Technology for cleaner diesel engine products.  We are a leader in the $100 billion global remanufacturing industry that conserves nonrenewable resources and provides cost-effective repair options for customers.  We continue to work with governments to promote the development and use of alternative fuels such as landfill gas, coal seam methane, ag biogas and digester gas for distributed power generation. Increasing our ability to convert these gases into clean energy while minimizing the need for additional power generation to meet the worldwide growth in demand not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions, but also represents a significant opportunity for growth.

					  <div class="text"><p><strong><a href="http://www.climatechangecapital.com">Climate Change Capital:</a></strong> Climate Change Capital (CCC) has been at the forefront of the carbon market, playing key roles in the design and implementation of the Kyoto mechanisms since their inception. With over 800 million under management, the Climate Change Capital Carbon Funds invest in emission reduction projects, primarily in emerging markets. Working closely with project developers, financial institutions and CDM and JI host governments, we use carbon finance as the catalyst for investment in clean energy and emission reductions.</p>
					  <p>The CCC Carbon Funds are developing a strong pipeline in the capture and utilisation of methane from Coal Mine Methane, Coal Bed Methane and Municipal Solid Waste Landfill.</p>
					  <p>CCC's technical partnership with Harworth Power, the engineering arm of the UK's largest coal company, ensures best practice in methane capture and drainage techniques in order to increase mine safety and production yield. This, together with CCC proprietary expertise in project design and Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) methodologies maximises the generation of Certified Emission Reductions (CERs). The CCC Carbon Funds offer flexible and innovative structures to fund projects and provide debt and equity finance.</p></div></div>
