                <p>Every two years, the EGBCM develops a report that summarizes emissions by the largest

                    contributing sectors and develops recommendations to policy makers on voluntary actions that
                    countries may wish to apply in different combinations in efforts to reduce emissions.

                    The report is tailored specifically for Arctic States, but the concepts are applicable to any
                    nation, region, or group looking to achieve reductions in methane and black carbon emissions.

                        of the progress by Arctic States and Observer States to reduce emissions of black carbon and
                        methane. The summary of progress is based on national information submitted in early 2018 and,

                            disposal. Overall methane emissions in the oil and gas sector appear to have remained stable
                            since 2013, which may present opportunities to improve detection and reduce emissions. In
                            solid waste management, significant reductions have been achieved in many countries, but
                            waste management is still a challenge in many remote communities in the Arctic.”
