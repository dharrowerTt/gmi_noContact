                <p>
                    In 2015, India, the world’s second largest coal producer, announced plans to double its coal production
                    in the next decade. Implementing coal mine methane (CMM) drainage and utilization projects will
                    provide a new, clean energy resource for India and help reduce the country’s greenhouse gas
                    emissions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Historically, several barriers have prevented the successful development of methane utilization projects,
                    including issues over CMM ownership, energy price controls, technology limitations, and market
                    readiness. In 2008, the Indian government established the
                    <a href="http://cmmclearinghouse.cmpdi.co.in/abt.php" target="_blank">India CMM/CBM
                        Clearinghouse</a>
                    (Clearinghouse) at the <a href="https://www.cmpdi.co.in/index.php?lang=Eng" target="_blank">Central
                        Mine Planning and Design Institute</a> (CMPDI) in Ranchi, India with
                    funding support from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA). The Clearinghouse’s goal
                    is to contribute to the commercial development of CMM/Coal Bed Methane (CBM) in India. The Clearinghouse has worked to
                    address barriers to methane utilization projects, and several commercial CMM/CBM projects are now
                    scheduled to be implemented in 2020.

                <h3>Transferring Gas Development Rights</h3>
                <p> <a href="https://www.coalindia.in/index-hi.html" target="_blank"><img
                            style="width:15%;margin-bottom: 10px; float: right;" src="images/cbm/logo.png">
                    </a>
                    One of the most significant developments to encourage CMM/CBM use in India was the 2018 decision by
                    the Indian government to transfer CMM and CBM gas development rights to <a
                        href="https://www.coalindia.in/index-hi.html" target="_blank">Coal India Ltd</a> and its
                    Subsidiaries within their coal mining leasehold blocks. Before the transfer, CMM and CBM development
                    required additional permits and approval by the <a href="http://petroleum.nic.in/"
                        target="_blank">Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas</a> (MoP&NG).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Clearinghouse facilitated this critical policy change by inviting U.S. representatives to attend
                    conferences in India to exchange information on CMM and CBM best practices. Indian officials also
                    visited CMM projects in the United States and met with U.S. government agencies responsible for CMM
                    and CBM project development.
                </p>
                <h3>Lifting Price Controls</h3>
                <p>Another important policy adjustment that encouraged project development was the lifting of price
                    controls on CBM in 2017. CBM prices can now exceed the rate set by the Indian government, allowing
                    companies to make the required capital investments to develop CMM and CBM projects. </p>
                <p>To facilitate this policy change, the Clearinghouse collaborated with the U.S. EPA to organize a
                    visit to the United States. During the visit, Indian government officials met with U.S. CMM and CBM
                    producers and U.S. government agency officials. The government representatives from India learned
                    about CMM and CBM incentives in the United States, including tax credits (“Section 29”) for
                    unconventional gas projects between the 1980s and early 1990s. These credits were largely
                    responsible for the rise of CBM development in the 1990s and the subsequent shale oil and gas boom
                    in the United States.</p>
                <h3>Addressing Technology Limitations</h3>
                <p>Recently, the Clearinghouse has been working to address technology limitations in India, focusing
                    specifically on improving drilling techniques. In previous years, Coal India Ltd personnel visited
                    the Warrior Met Coal Mines in Alabama to learn about Warrior Met’s implementation of directional
                    drilling technology. In April 2019, the Clearinghouse co-hosted a workshop with the Global Methane
                    Initiative (GMI) in Ranchi, India. The workshop focused on directional drilling technology and other
                    degasification and utilization technologies. </p>
                <h3>Taking Action</h3>
                <p>With this multifaceted approach and targeted strategy, India is now on track to launch its first CMM
                    utilization project in 2020. Coal India’s <a
                    href="Bharat Coking Coal Limited" target="_blank">Bharat Coking Coal Limited</a>  (BCCL) will implement an
                    underground directional drilling project at the Moonidih UG mine in 2020. The project will increase
                    methane drainage from coal seams prior to mining. BCCL plans to hire a developer to perform the
                    drilling, produce the methane, and operate a 2 megawatt power generator to be fueled by the methane
                    that is produced. </p>
