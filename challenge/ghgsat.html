                <h3>Measuring Effectiveness</h3>
                <p>GHGSat, a global emissions monitoring firm based in Canada, has the capability to detect methane emissions at industrial facilities from space.
                    Its growing fleet of satellites provides data and actionable information on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to an increasing number of emitters and regulators. 
                    This insight allows companies to identify trends in emissions and track when emissions are reduced or eliminated. </p>
                <p>Additionally, GHGSat informs oil and gas operators when leaks have been detected, and oil and gas operators are
                    able to track methane and other GHG emissions reductions through continuous
                    monitoring. Once leaks are repaired, those sites no longer emit GHGs.</p>

                        <h3>Collaboration with Canada’s Oil Sands Innovation Alliance (COISA)</h3>
                        <p><img src="images/ghgsat/1.jpg" style="max-width:200px; float:right;">Since 2015, GHGSat has been working with Canada’s Oil Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA) to
                            measure GHG emissions from challenging sources in oil sands operations in Alberta,
                            Canada.</p>
                        <p>The project will develop a modelling system that will allow COSIA members to use GHGSat’s
                            innovative satellite technology to measure fugitive emissions in the atmosphere above two
                            tailings ponds and one mine face. COISA members will calculate emissions rates based on those
                            measurements and compare them with more conventional technology measurements.</p>
                        <p>The technology being tested could replace the current method used to estimate area fugitive
                            emissions from oil sands operations. This is expected to improve the accuracy of the estimates
                            and potentially increase the frequency at which estimates are made. The project also has the
                            benefit of avoiding safety risks associated with making ground-based measurements, and the
                            cost of conducting measurement campaigns could likely be lower as well.</p>

                        <p><img src="images/ghgsat/2.png" style="max-width:200px; float:right;">Natural gas production from shale formations (“shale gas”) has grown rapidly in recent years.
                            Satellite measurement is an ideal method for monitoring methane emissions from shale gas
                            operations that are spread out over vast territories. Without any on-site equipment, GHGSat’s high-resolution satellites can identify super-emitters through periodic
                            surveys of all shale gas operations, at a fraction of the cost of current methods.</p>

                            <p>As of 2019, GHGSat aircraft measurements will provide very high-resolution measurements of
                            shale gas plays to complement GHGSat satellite measurements. These measurements from 
                            GHGSat aircraft sensors will enable detection of smaller leaks and
                            localize those leaks within a facility to facilitate repair. GHGSat aircraft sensors will
                            leverage the same post-processing toolchain used by its satellites, thereby cross-validating
                            results and providing cost-effective aircraft services.</p>

                        <p><img src="images/ghgsat/3.png" style="max-width:200px; float:right;">GHGSat is working with several customers to demonstrate the use of satellite-based remote sensing technology to monitor GHG emissions from hydro reservoirs. </p>
                            <p>For example, GHGSat conducted demonstrations with hydro operators that included measurements of dams, reservoirs and reference sites over a full year. 
                                Analytics included both point-source and area emissions estimates, and variations over time/seasons. 
                                Coincident measurements were generally limited to water sampling, over a short period of time. 
                            <p>GHGSat has publicly released a satellite measurement of methane emissions from the Lom Pangar Dam in Cameroon. The full dataset is available, free of charge, upon request at info@ghgsat.com.

                            Unconventional Oil and Gas Processing</h3>
                        <p><img src="images/canada/flarenet.png" style="float:right;">FlareNet is an NSERC Strategic
                            Network with an objective to provide a quantitative understanding of flare generated
                            pollutant emissions critical to enabling science-based policy, accurate pollutant
                            inventories, understanding of climate forcing and health implications, and engineering
                            design and assessment of mitigation strategies to minimize environmental impacts in the
                            energy sector. </p>
                        <p>Flaring is the most commonly deployed approach to reduce methane emissions from gaseous
                            waste streams. Recently published work in FlareNet (Tyner & Johnson, EST, 2018), has also
                            shown that flaring and incineration are likely to increase significantly as new methane
                            regulations are implemented. Since the start of serious discussion of methane regulations
                            from 2016-2018, reported flaring is trending up at (oil/bitumen/gas batteries, gas
                            gathering systems and gas plants) with a year over year increase of 8 percent.</p>
                        <p>Quantitative understanding of flare generated pollutant emissions are thus critical for
                            informing appropriate mitigation actions and understanding implications, including impacts
                            of policy and regulatory decisions. This is a key goal of FlareNet.</p>

                        <p><img src="images/canada/nserc.jpg" style="float:left;">The FlareNet Network is a 5-year
                            $6.9M project funded by NSERC ($5.5M over 5 years) with contributions from government
                            agencies, industry and Canadian universities (NRCan contribution includes $835,000 and
                            in-kind support). The Network integrates a diverse group of researchers working on research
                            challenges through collaborative large-scale experiments backed by field measurements. </p>

                        <p>Experiments occur at two main research facilities — the Carleton University
                            Intermediate-Scale Flare Facility and the Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel Facility at the

                            Researchers associated with the University of Alberta are quantifying GHG emissions from 60
                            ranches in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. They are investigating the use of 5 adaptive
                            multi-paddock grazing approaches on GHG emissions.</p>

                        <p>In 2016, Canada create the Agricultural Greenhouse Gases Program (AGGP). The goal of this
                            five-year (2016-2021) program aims to enhance the understanding and accessibility of
                            agricultural technologies, beneficial management practices (BMPs) and processes that can be
                            adopted by farmers to mitigate agricultural greenhouse (GHGs) emissions in Canada.</p>
                        <p>The AGGP aims to support initiatives that have the potential to lead the way to broader
                            adoption or application of BMPs on farm and by the sector more generally. The program also
                            aims to support efforts to understand the potential impacts of GHGs as well as approaches
                            to mitigate agricultural GHG emissions. The AGGP hopes this information will result in
                            better strategies for climate change adaptation across the agricultural sector.</p>
                        <p>The AGGP ultimately contribute to the mitigation of GHG emissions and other positive
                            longer-term environmental impacts for Canada, which in turn supports the Government of
