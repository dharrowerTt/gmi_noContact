                    During oil production, associated gas is produced with the oil, and this associated gas consists
                    primarily of methane. Although this gas is often captured and utilized or conserved, some is flared
                    because of a wide range of technical, regulatory, or economic constraints. Flares at oil production
                    sites around the world burn approximately 145 billion cubic meters of associated gas each year,
                    resulting in emissions to the atmosphere of more than 370 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide
                    equivalent (MMTCO<sub>2</sub>e). Flaring also wastes a valuable natural resource that could be used
                    to increase
                    energy access and advance the sustainable development of oil-producing countries. For instance, the
                    amount of gas flared annually across the globe could power the entire African continent.

                    Nigeria is a prominent and noteworthy example of a country that is taking concrete and innovative
                    action in its commitment to achieve Zero Routine Flaring by 2030. The country has embarked on a
                    first-of-its-kind program to tackle gas flaring. The World Bank has been advising and supporting the
                    Government of Nigeria develop and implement its
                    <a href="https://ngfcp.dpr.gov.ng/" target="_blank">
                        Nigeria Gas Flare Commercialisation
                        Programme </a>(NGFCP), which was created by the government to achieve its commitments under the
                    <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/zero-routine-flaring-by-2030" target="_blank">“Zero
                        Routine Flaring by 2030”</a> Initiative. </p>
                <p>

                    Through the NGFCP, the Government of Nigeria is taking a comprehensive approach by
                    commercializing the associated gas as an asset rather than an unwanted byproduct of oil production.
                    The NGFCP will offer the associated gas for sale to third parties through a transparent and
                    competitive bidding process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nigeria provides an example of how governments can take a leading role in reducing gas flaring
                    and emissions, while adopting a market-driven approach to monetizing associated gas that
                    otherwise would have been flared. The NGFCP is the first example of a country creating a
                    regulatory framework enabling third parties to monetize and use flared gas.

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Over 250 local and international applicants (third parties) have shown interest by
                            submitting statements of qualification to Nigeria’s Department of Petroleum Resources
                            (DPR).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Oil industry operators are assessing more critically the costs (including
                            environmental and social costs) associated with flaring versus partnering with midstream
                            companies to develop associated gas-to-market solutions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Other governments are watching Nigeria’s approach closely to see how they can replicate
                            this model or use elements of the NGFCP to end routine flaring in their countries.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The NGFCP contributes to Nigeria’s economic development by combining policy, regulation,
                    guidelines, contractual arrangements, bidding processes, market intelligence, institutional
                    capabilities, and data management to bring to market a valuable domestic natural resource. This
                    cost-effective solution puts an otherwise wasted resource into productive use, resulting in
                    improvements to the local environment (particularly the Niger Delta) and the communities
                    affected by flaring.
                </p>
                The Programme has the potential to:

                            Reduce Nigeria’s current gas flaring by 65 percent or 4.8 billion cubic meters
