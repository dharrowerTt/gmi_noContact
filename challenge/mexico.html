                    One of the country’s most significant actions to reduce methane emissions is the publication of the
                    regulation “Guidelines for the Prevention and Integral Control of Methane Emissions from the
                    Hydrocarbon Sector”, which went into effect on November 7th, 2018. These legally-binding Guidelines
                    were published by Mexico’s Agency for Safety, Energy and Environment (ASEA), and are the outcome of
                    an extensive collaboration with expert international NGOs and a public consultation process in
                    which more than 500 comments were received. They are based on international regulations and best
                    practices. The implementation of the guidelines intends to contribute to the reduction of methane
                    emissions worldwide, in agreement with the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) study which states
                    that applying best practices such as those included in the Guidelines, at a global level, the
                    Hydrocarbon Sector can achieve a reduction up to 75% of methane emissions. In addition, the Study
                    also states that a 50% reduction can be achieved at no net cost<sup>

                    Additionally, the Guidelines
                    consider the possibility of introducing new and improved best practices and different scenarios for
                    new and existing oil and gas facilities. The intent of the Guidelines is to achieve methane
                    emission reductions that will enable the Mexican Hydrocarbon Sector to lead the world in
                    environmental sustainability internationally.

                <h3>Additional Information</h3>
                <h4>Deadlines for Existing Facilities: </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>November 7, 2019 (a year after the regulation goes into effect): The regulated entity (facility) must complete its PPCIEM, including the diagnosis, goal establishment and LDAR program.</li>
                    <li>February 2020: regulated facilities must submit to the Agency the PPCIEM as well as the 3rd party favorable opinion (Dictamination).</li>
                    <li>First quarter 2021: each regulated facility must provide its first annual compliance report as well as the 3rd party favorable opinion.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Deadlines for New Facilities </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>A year after the regulated facility begins operations the Regulated must have its PPCIEM which includes the diagnosis and LDAR program. Three months following, the facility must submit to the Agency the PPCIEM as well as the 3rd party favorable opinion (Dictamination).</li>
                    <li>The annual compliance report, with a third party favorable opinion, will be submitted to the Agency as follows:</li>
                    <ol type="I">
                        <li>In the first quarter of the second calendar year of PPCIEM implementation if the facility has been operating for less than six months after the PPCIEM submission.</li>
                        <li>In the first quarter of the first calendar year of PPCIEM implementation if the facility has been operating six months or more after the PPCIEM submission.</li>
                    </ol>
                </ul>
                <h4>Sanctions </h4>
                <ul><li>The Guidelines for methane emission reduction are mandatory and as such ASEA can impose sanctions, financial and operational, in a case of non-compliance. However, ASEA favors a “corrective enforcement” scheme under which, the Regulated will find a solution and achieve the established reduction thus consolidating the goal of the regulatory piece. </li></ul>
