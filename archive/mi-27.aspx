            Since 2007, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has funded projects that
            support the goals of the Global Methane Initiative (GMI): advancing near-term, cost-effective
            methane abatement or recovery and use as a clean energy source. These grants become
            catalysts for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction projects, technology demonstration,
            and capacity-building efforts in GMI Partner Countries. Throughout upcoming newsletters,
            the Administrative Support Group (ASG) would like to highlight the progress of grant
            awardees.</p>

            of coal mine methane (CMM) recovery at the Nalaikh Coal Mine in Mongolia. The study
            identified three drilling sites that could support a 3.6-megawatt (MW) <a href="../activities/actDetails.aspx?ID=1083">
                power generation and heating project</a>, which will reduce 96,390 metric tons
            of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO<sub>2</sub>E). Currently, drilling in the mine
            area is being jointly financed by the Mongolian and <strong>Korean</strong> governments.</p>
        <p>
            Also as part of the grant, the MNEC hosted a workshop to discuss the opportunities
            and use of methane for sustainable development, policy and ownership issues, and
            identify the needs of the Mongolian mining industry regarding CMM. This past year,
            EPA awarded the Consortium an additional <a href="../projects/projectDetail.aspx?ID=1200">
                GMI grant</a> to continue its activities to develop an assessment of Mongolian
            CMM resources.</p>

            methane emissions. Gazprom is <strong>Russia's</strong> largest energy producer,
            and working to reduce methane emissions from the company's activities would significantly
            reduce methane emissions in Russia. EDF used the funding to conduct a pilot study
            to assess Gazprom's methane emissions and potential cost-effective project opportunities,
            and then provided recommendations for establishing a corporate methane management
            system. The project also analyzed advanced economic mechanisms for attracting investment
            for viable methane emission reduction projects. This project is still ongoing.</p>

                $75,000 grant</a>, CDR worked with the Ethiopian Environmental Protection Authority
            to conduct an assessment of the methane reduction potential from agricultural sources
            in the country and to develop their sector action plan. A <a href="#seven">workshop</a>
            was held in Addis Ababa in November to discuss the results of this work. After these
            reports are finalized, they will be posted on the GMI website.</p>

            CDR also received an <a href="../projects/projectDetail.aspx?ID=1213">$80,000 grant</a>
            to work in the landfill sector, which consists mostly of uncontrolled disposal sites
            managed by municipalities. The project focused on the challenges of waste disposal
            through capacity building and resulted in a country-specific profile and strategic
            plan. Daniel Fikreyesus, with CDR, <a href="http://africacarbonforum.com/2011/docs/Presentations/D3/GMI/Presentation1.pdf">

            <p>
                Save the date for the 2013 Expo. The Expo will take place on 12-15 March 2013 in
                Vancouver, Canada.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            In 2013 GMI will be hosting its third Expo in Vancouver, <strong>Canada.</strong>
            To launch the planning process, the GMI Expo Task Force convened via teleconference
            on 25 January 2012. Participants included Partner Country representatives from Canada,
            China, Colombia, India, Nigeria, Poland, the United Kingdom, and the United States,
            as well as numerous Project Network members.</p>
        <p>
            Partner organization Environment Canada, the in-country host organization, announced
            the Expo will be held during the week of 11 March 2013 at the Vancouver Convention
            Center, a state-of-the-art meeting venue. The ASG provided a brief Expo history
            (i.e., 2007 in Beijing, 2010 in New Delhi) and explained the role of the Task Force
            in the Expo process (e.g., planning, outreach). The ASG also outlined the call for
            abstracts, which serves to help identify technical and policy session topics and
            speakers, and the purpose of the project opportunity posters. Environment Canada
            reviewed its proposed meeting format&mdash;comprised of general plenary and concurrent
            sector-specific elements similar to past Expos&mdash;and invited input from Task
            Force members.</p>
        <p>
            The Task Force teleconference concluded with a consensus to hold monthly calls leading
            up to the Expo; the next call will take place on Wednesday, 22 February 2012. Anyone
            interested in participating in the Expo Task Force and/or sharing input on possible
            session topics or project opportunities should email the <a href="mailto:secretariat@globalmethane.org">

                Fact Sheets Updated</h2>
            <p>
                In November 2011, the ASG released new GMI sector fact sheets for agriculture, coal
                mines, landfills, and oil and gas. The fact sheets, which are available on the <a
                    href="../tools-resources/index.aspx">GMI website</a>, are a great resource to
                educate organizations about GMI activities.</p>
            <p>
                GMI is seeking volunteers to translate these fact sheets into other languages. For
                more information or to volunteer, please contact the <a href="mailto:secretariat@globalmethane.org">
                    ASG</a>.</p>

            <strong><em>Agriculture</em></strong><br />
            In January 2012, GMI posted the <a href="../documents/ag_turkey_res_assessment.pdf">
                <em>Resource Assessment for Livestock and Agro-Industrial Wastes&mdash;<strong>Turkey</strong></em></a>
            (PDF, 55 pp, 904K). The results show that the sugar beet sector has the highest
            potential to reduce methane emissions, followed by the fruit processing industry,
            dairies, and slaughterhouses. Turkey has the potential to produce 31,800 kilowatts
            of electricity annually from biogas harnessed from the agricultural sectors evaluated.</p>
        <p>
            The ASG would like to announce that Allison Costa, with U.S. EPA's AgSTAR Program,
            will be joining Jorge Hilbert with <strong>Argentina's</strong> National Institute
            of Agriculture Technology and Anil Dhussa with <strong>India's</strong> Ministry
            of New and Renewable Energy, as the newest Co-Chair for the Agriculture Subcommittee.
            The ASG would also like to remind all Partners to submit data to populate the International
            Anaerobic Digester Database in the <a href="../documents/events_ag_20110614_dbtemplate.xls">
                Excel template</a> (XLS, 178K). The database will collect information about
            the size and type of digesters in each country, as well as planned projects. The
            purpose is to help others see what types of systems and technologies are working
            well in their region, to help GMI track digester projects, and to show where there
            might be a need for more digester development. Please review the <a href="../documents/events_ag_20110614_dbglossary.pdf">
                glossary</a> (PDF, 6 pp, 107K) for assistance in filling out the template. The
            Agriculture Subcommittee is planning its next meeting to take place within the next
            6 months, with a webinar being planned for the following quarter; more information
            will be available soon.</p>
        <p>
            <strong><em>Coal Mine</em></strong><br />
            The Coal Mine Subcommittee is planning to hold a webinar in May 2012. The next in-person
            subcommittee meeting is likely to be scheduled for the first week of September in
            <strong>Australia</strong>. More information about these events will be available
            soon on <a href="../coal-mines/index.aspx">GMI's website</a>.</p>
        <p>
            <strong><em>Landfills</em></strong><br />
            The Landfill Subcommittee is continuing its work on an international landfill gas
            (LFG) best practices guide. The Subcommittee will be initiating a peer review process
            in early 2012 and expects to publish the guide by the end of 2012. The ASG would
            also like to take the opportunity to thank Gabriel Blanco from <strong>Argentina</strong>
            and Rachel Goldstein from the <strong>United States</strong> for their tremendous
            service and assistance to GMI as Co-Chairs to the Landfill Subcommittee. Both, have
            recently changed positions within their respective countries and have stepped down
            from their Co-Chair position, though Gabriel will continue to represent Argentina
            within the Landfill Subcommittee as a designated country delegate. Tom Frankiewicz
            with U.S. EPA's Landfill Methane Outreach Program (LMOP) will join Sandra Lopez
            Tovar with <strong>Colombia's</strong> Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable
            Development as the newest Co-Chair of the Landfill Subcommittee. The Landfill Subcommittee
            is planning its next meeting to take place within the next 6 months, with a webinar
            being planned for the following quarter; more information will be available soon.</p>
        <p>
            <strong><em>Oil &amp; Gas</em></strong><br />
            The next Oil &amp; Gas Subcommittee meeting will be held on 12-13 April 2012 in
            Denver, Colorado, <strong>United States</strong>. The meeting will be held in conjunction
            with the U.S. EPA's <a href="http://www.epa.gov/gasstar/workshops/annualimplementation/2012.html">

            which will take place on 10-12 April 2012. The ASG has met with the Oil &amp; Gas
            Subcommittee Co-Chairs to draft the meeting agenda. Based on discussions with the
            Co-Chairs, there is significant interest in discussing GMI Action Plans, National
            Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA) plan development (templates and overall GMI
            and business case context), and the upcoming 2013 GMI Expo. Additionally, Partner
            Countries will be asked to discuss recent activities, along with those in the coming
            year. The Co-Chairs feel that sharing anticipated activities will enable the subcommittee,
            as well as Partner Countries and Project Network members, to be more supportive.
            If you have any meeting agenda topic suggestions, please email them to the <a href="mailto:secretariat@globalmethane.org">

            <strong><em>Municipal Wastewater</em></strong><br />
            Municipal wastewater was introduced as an official GMI sector in October 2011. The
            Municipal Wastewater Subcommittee will be focusing on methane reduction and reuse
            from wastewater treatment systems in GMI's Partner Countries. The subcommittee is
            going to be busy over the next few months organizing and planning a webinar to kick-off
            the subcommittee, developing a sector action plan, and creating a municipal wastewater
            factsheet. Chris Godlove with U.S. EPA's LMOP will be helping to lead the effort
            as the subcommittee's first Co-Chair. The <a href="mailto:secretariat@globalmethane.org">ASG</a>
            is currently recruiting nominations for other Co-Chairs and sector representatives
            from interested Partner Countries.</p>

            to address GHG emissions.</p>

            <strong><em>North America</em></strong><br />
            From 26 to 30 September 2011, representatives from <strong>Mexico</strong> and <strong>
                Serbia</strong> traveled to the <strong>United States</strong> to attend a four-day
            tour of LFG energy project sites in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.
            Nearly 20 people participated in the tours and visited a total of seven LFG energy
            projects. Site visits provided the participants with ideas for successfully utilizing
            LFG in direct-use applications, which are not typical in Mexico and Serbia. This
            was the second study tour of LFG energy projects in the U.S. conducted by the U.S.
            EPA under GMI.</p>

            <li>On 16 February 2012, <strong>U.S.</strong> Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton,
                along with environmental ministers and ambassadors from <strong>Bangladesh, Canada,
                    Ghana, Mexico, Sweden,</strong> the <strong>United States</strong> and the executive
                director of the United Nation Environment Programme, <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2012/02/184061.htm">
                    announced the launch</a> <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx" title="Exiting Global Methane Initiative">
                        <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>
                of a new international initiative that will focus efforts on reducing short-lived
                climate pollutants including black carbon, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and methane.
                Information and press releases from the GMI Partner Countries involved can be found
                on <a href="ne_slcf.aspx">GMI's News and Events Page</a>.</li>
            <li>Partner Country <strong>Australia</strong> passed a plan for a carbon tax in July
                2011, as part of their <a href="http://www.cleanenergyfuture.gov.au/clean-energy-future/our-plan/">
                    Clean Energy Future (CEF) Plan</a> <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx" title="Exiting Global Methane Initiative">
                        <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>.
                The plan includes comprehensive measures aimed to reach Australia's GHG emission
                reduction targets and will establish a carbon pricing mechanism by 1 July 2012.
                The mechanism is expected to tax 500 of Australia's biggest emitters. Included in
                the CEF Plan is more than $13 billion in assistance for clean energy projects.</li>
