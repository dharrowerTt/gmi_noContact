            In October 2011, more than 160 Partner Country representatives, government leaders,
            and technical experts from 31 countries gathered in historic Krakow, <strong>Poland,</strong>
            for the Global Methane Initiative's (GMI's) <a href="meeting20111012.aspx">Partnership-wide
                meeting</a>. The meeting began with site tours offered in the Initiatives' four
            sectors of interest&mdash;agriculture, coal, landfill, and oil and gas&mdash;as
            well as a reception and tour of World Heritage Site Wieliczka Salt Mine.</p>
        <p>
            The next day, Marcin Korolec, Undersecretary of State with Poland's Ministry of
            Economy, welcomed attendees to the informational sessions. He emphasized the importance
            of methane as a clean energy source and how GMI provides an excellent platform for
            international cooperation. Also part of the opening session was William Heidt, Deputy
            Chief of Mission at the <strong>U.S.</strong> Embassy; Paul Gunning, Acting Director,
            U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Climate Change Division; H&#229;vard
            Toresen, Deputy Director General from <strong>Norway's</strong> Ministry of the
            Environment, GMI's newest Partner Country (<a href="#two">see below</a>); and Zbigniew
            Kamienski, Deputy Director from Poland's Ministry of Economy.</p>
        <p>
            Other items covered during the meeting included the announcement of a fifth subcommittee,
            the Municipal Wastewater Subcommittee. Partner Country delegates are encouraged
            to email the <a href="mailto:secretariat@globalmethane.org">ASG</a> to nominate a representative
            to be involved with the new subcommittee. ASG also announced that <strong>Canada

            The <a href="../agriculture/index.aspx">agricultural sector</a> activities included
            a site visit, technical sessions, and a subcommittee meeting. Nearly 20 participants
            went to Grodziec Slaski, where they toured an agricultural anaerobic digestion (AD)
            system at the National Research Institute of Animal Production. At the Institute,
            manure from cows and hogs is processed along with waste from an ethanol plant in
            an onsite AD system.</p>
        <p>
            The agricultural technical session covered financing options for project development,
            an overview of national standards and policies that increase the adoption of AD,
            and highlights on AD projects from around the globe. The technical sessions also
            included a discussion on international collaboration helping to make AD projects
            operational and successful.</p>
        <p>
            The Agriculture Subcommittee meeting included Partner Country updates from GMI representatives
            from <strong>Argentina, Canada, India, Poland, Thailand</strong>, and the <strong>United
                States</strong>. Updates were also provided by Project Network members on AD
            projects in <strong>Ethiopia, Germany, Pakistan,</strong> and the <strong>United Kingdom</strong>.
            The meeting also included an update on the status of the international AD database,
            which will be used to track information about AD projects in GMI Partner Countries.
            The ASG is asking people to submit data for it in an <a href="../documents/events_ag_20110614_dbtemplate.xls">

        </div>
        <p>
            Activities for the <a href="../coal-mines/index.aspx">coal mines sector</a> included
            a site tour, a subcommittee meeting, and technical breakout sessions. Twenty-five
            participants from 14 countries traveled to the Central Mining Institute of Katowice's
            experimental mine &quot;Barbara,&quot; where researchers discussed their work in
            improving mine safety. They demonstrated the potential impact of a coal dust explosion
            by conducting a real explosion in their test mine. Following this visit, participants
            visited Jastrz&#281;bska Sp&#243;&#322;ka W&#281;glowa S.A.'s &quot;Pniowek&quot;
            hard coal mine, where coal mine methane (CMM) is recovered and utilized in a 10
            megawatt (MW) electric power project and evaporative cooling system.</p>
        <p>
            The breakout sessions covered best practices for CMM drainage and utilization, new
            and developing CMM technologies, discussions on unique methane sources from surface
            mines and ventilation air methane, an introduction to <strong>Australia's</strong>
            Clean Energy Future package and Coal Sector Assistance package, and an overview
            of CMM activities in <strong>Poland</strong>. Perspectives on best practices, technologies,
            sources, policy, and project development were provided by representatives from several
            countries, including <strong>Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Switzerland,
                the United Kingdom, </strong>and<strong> the United States.</strong></p>
        <p>
            The Coal Mine Subcommittee meeting focused on discussing a draft policy paper to
            respond to the Steering Committee's discussion regarding the potential impacts of
            expanding the Initiative to include methane abatement and flaring. The draft paper
            noted that the first priority for CMM projects would be to recover and utilize the
            methane, but flaring may be an appropriate abatement strategy in some cases. In
            addition, Partner Country delegates and Project Network members also discussed the
            draft CMM technology database, and noted that it would be a living document to store
            information about emerging technologies and businesses in the sector. Additionally,
            representatives from Partner Countries, including acting Co-Chairs from <strong>China</strong>
            and <strong>India</strong>, shared updates related to CMM activities.</p>

            <strong><em>Landfills</em></strong></p>
        <p>
            On 12 October, more than 35 attendees visited the &quot;Barycz&quot; Landfill outside
            of Krakow to see a state-of-the-art integrated solid waste management facility.
            The landfill hosts one of over 80 new landfill gas (LFG) energy projects that came
            online or under construction over the last five years in <strong>Poland</strong>
            due, in large part to a favorable green pricing tariff. The LFG energy project generates
            1.3 MW using four internal combustion engines. The landfill also contains an innovative
            green waste composting facility and sophisticated waste sorting plant where recyclable
            materials are recovered and sold for reuse.</p>
        <p>
            Breakout sessions for the <a href="../landfills/index.aspx">landfill sector</a>
            were well attended, with more than 35 people at each session. The first session
            focused on the transition from Methane to Markets to GMI's expanded scope and included
            topics on methane avoidance, lessons learned from integrated solid waste management
            strategies in Europe, and new incentives to promote clean energy. A session on the
            importance of waste management in Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs)
            and the role of GMI in these efforts was presented by GMI Partners <strong>Colombia</strong>
            and <strong>Serbia</strong>. The third session focused on technical and financial
            factors in the development and operation of LFG and wastewater energy projects,
            including an innovative leachate treatment system that may be suitable for application
            in GMI Partner Countries. The final session focused on the challenges and opportunities
            for advancing LFG energy in Poland by two of the hosts &ndash; the Oil and Gas Institute
            and the Ministry of Environment.</p>
        <p>
            The Landfill Subcommittee meeting discussed activities for the remainder of 2011,
            such as the finalization and distribution of an international LFG best practices
            guide. Based on charges from the Steering Committee, they discussed modifying the
            Landfill Subcommittee name to reflect the new expanded scope, developing longer-term
            planning goals, and forming a taskforce to assist with planning for the 2013 GMI
            Expo, including developing technical content and project ideas.</p>

            Allison Costa, with U.S. EPA's AgSTAR Program, traveled to <strong>Nicaragua</strong>
            to meet with representatives from Partner organization Nicaragua's <a href="../partners/partnerProfile.aspx?ID=1624">
                Ministry of Energy and Mines</a>. Nicaragua is dedicated to reducing methane
            emissions as well as increasing the amount of energy provided by renewable sources
            and increasing energy efficiency. The country has recently completed an action plan
            for their landfill sector and is now interested in working on their agriculture
            sector action plan. The development of the landfill action plan is being used as
            a model to create the agriculture action plan. The development for each was initiated
            by Julio C. Perez Aguilar from Nicaragua's Ministry of Energy and Mines. For the
            landfill action plan, Mr. Aguilar convened a group of stakeholders across the industry
            to get their feedback on the plan, which was seen as such a great opportunity to
            learn and network from each other that the group intends to continue its meetings.
            The goal is to achieve a similar, successful outcome with the stakeholder group
            for an agricultural sector action plan. The visit also included tours at two farms
            that do not have AD systems, but are interested in pursuing the option of implementing
            an AD system.</p>

            Chris Godlove from U.S. EPA's LMOP, traveled to <strong>Chile</strong> to take part
            in two events. First, Chris presented at a seminar in Valpara&iacute;so hosted by
            Universidad Catolica de Valpara&iacute;so. The seminar focused on methane emissions
            from wastewater treatment systems in Latin America. He also visited El Molle Landfill,
            which is the main landfill for the Valpara&iacute;so region. Owners of El Molle
            Landfill, Stericycle, hope to develop an LFG energy project at the landfill and
            learned about GMI assistance available to support a project. The second event occurred
            in Santiago, where Chris attended a follow-up meeting with the Biogas Working Group
            hosted by Partner organization Chile's Ministry of Energy. The working group is
            composed representatives from the Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Environment, Ministry
            of Health, SUDERE (a company responsible for construction of landfills), and the
            Center for Renewable Energies who are working together to support the development
            of biogas projects in Chile.</p>

            <li>In Partner Country <strong>Pakistan</strong>, the Karachi Electric Supply Company
                announced plans for a $70 million biogas project at the Landhi Cattle Colony in
                Karachi. Canadian consultant Highmark Renewables International will build the facility.
                After completion, the generators are expected to produce 30 MW by harnessing the
                daily methane produced from 3,000 tons of food and animal waste.<br />

                The Mexico Landfill Project Protocol provides guidance to quantify, report, and
                verify greenhouse gas emission reductions associated with installing an LFG collection
                and destruction system at landfill operations in Mexico. Version 1.1 builds on the
                original protocol, including a modified project start date definition, an added
                option for a second project crediting period, improvements to the quantification
                methodology, and the addition of guidance for the verification protocol.<br />

            <li>In Partner Country <strong>Chile</strong>, a new KDM Energ&iacute;a LFG energy project
                became operational earlier this year at Lomas Los Colorados Landfill near Santiago.
                The $40 million USD project will create 15 MW to help supply local homes with energy.
                International incentives helped to make the investments in projects such as this
                more attractive. Under the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol, KDM
                Energ&iacute;a will receive greenhouse gas emission reduction credits that can be
                sold to industrialized countries to offset their own emissions. Also, as a member
                of the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/pages/">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
                    Development (OECD)</a> <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx" title="Exiting Global Methane Initiative">

                an organization that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being
                of people around the world, Chile committed to increase its environmental policies.
                This has encouraged the development of renewable energy projects such as this LFG
                energy project.<br />
