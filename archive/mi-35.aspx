        </b>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
            Global Methane Initiative (GMI) project partners have completed the second phase
            of development of a community-based landfill gas (LFG) utilization project in Maracanau,
            Brazil. Using funding from GMI, experience from the <a target="_blank" href="http://energy.appstate.edu/">
                Appalachian State University (ASU) Energy Center</a> in North Carolina, USA,
            and an array of partners in Maracanau, the project is becoming a reality and a model
            for other communities in Brazil and throughout Latin America.</p>
        <p style="width: 170px; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 15px;
            padding: 6px; border: 1px solid #0076bf; float: right;">
            <img src="/images/maracanau.png" style="width: 150px;" alt="Maracanau's community-based LFG utilization project" />
            <i class="small">The community of Maracanau, Brazil, where the ASU Energy Center developed a community-based
                LFG utilization project.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Maracanau Landfill Project began with a preliminary grant funded by the U.S.
            Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) in 2009 and has continued with a second
            development grant from GMI, awarded in 2011. The ASU Energy Center has partnered
            with the Maracanau municipal government, the ANIMA Institute of Sustainable Technology,
            the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ufc.br/">Federal University of Ceara</a>,
            the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.unifor.br/">University of Fortaleza</a>,
            and the <i>Catadores</i> Association of Maracanau (COOMVIDA).</p>
        <p>
            In addition to supporting the Maracanau community with biogas, the project is specifically
            designed to work with Maracanau's population of <i>catadores</i>, or waste-pickers.
            About 75 families in the municipality subsist as <i>catadores</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Project leaders, including leaders from COOMVIDA, hope that the project will result
            in better, safer, and higher-paying jobs for the <i>catadores</i>—some have already
            moved into jobs collecting, sorting, and shipping recyclables from the landfill's
            waste stream. The project team hopes that they can add significant value—and project
            income—once they install a processing center for glass and plastics.</p>
        <p>
            The second phase of work on the Maracanau landfill has seen several key accomplishments.
            The project has been successfully developed and project control is transitioning
            to a local governing organization, the Maracanau Green Methane Committee. The committee
            has approved a construction-ready design for the LFG energy project site and developed
            an integrated business plan. The plan comes with secured funding sources for pieces
            of the project and lays out expected income sources, including supplemental income
            sources such as the value-added recyclables from the <i>catadores</i> and the sale
            of carbon credits. The plan demonstrates the viability and duplicability of a project
            of this size, which will help the project gain support across public and private
            organizations in Brazil.</p>

        <br />
        <p>
            More than 80 participants from about 20 companies, government ministries, and universities
            attended the third Asia Pacific GMI Oil & Gas Sector Workshop, hosted by Indonesia's
            Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources in Bandung, Indonesia, on 27–28 August
            2014. The workshop's first day brought together key government representatives and
            industry leaders from Southeast Asia to discuss how practical methane mitigation
            in the oil & gas sector will help Indonesia achieve its ambitious national climate
            protection goal. Keynote speakers from the Indonesian government reinforced their
            commitments to GMI and assured their support for expanding the program in Indonesia.
            Industry speakers shared their practical experiences with GMI and their plans to
            identify, measure, and reduce methane emissions. The conference concluded with a
            speech from His Excellency the Vice Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, who
            encouraged the oil and gas industry to take quick action to implement GMI's practical
            solutions, and was punctuated by Pertamina E&P signing the Natural Gas STAR International
            Memorandum of Understanding.</p>
        <p>
            On the second day of the workshop, more than 60 participants travelled to a Pertamina
            production facility in Subang for a field demonstration of methane emission detection
            and quantification equipment. Participants had the opportunity to learn firsthand
            how critical tools, including the infrared gas imaging camera and high-flow sampler,
            are used in the field to quickly detect methane emissions and measure the volume
            of gas losses. The field demonstration showed how advanced analytical tools can
            improve methane management and increase operational efficiency and safety.</p>
        <p>
            The U.S. EPA conducted a field methane emissions measurement study with its Natural
            Gas STAR International Partner, VICO Indonesia, at several oil and gas production
            facilities from 30 August to 3 September 2014. In addition to finding and measuring
            methane emissions at VICO's operational facilities in East Kalimantan, this study
            provided hands-on training to VICO staff to help improve their use of leak detection
            and measurement equipment. The study's findings will lay the foundation for future
            VICO projects to recover and utilize methane that might otherwise be lost to the
            atmosphere.</p>

        <strong><i>Oil and Gas</i></strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
            The Oil & Gas Subcommittee recently finalized its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.globalmethane.org/documents/og-statement-of-purpose.pdf">
                Statement of Purpose</a> (PDF, 5pp, 424KB). This document lays out the subcommittee's
            goals and identifies how other organizations might help achieve them, defines primary
            key stakeholders, and communicates these stakeholders' roles. The document was created
            by the subcommittee Co-Chairs with input from delegates and Project Network members.
            Moving forward, the subcommittee agreed to periodically review and, as appropriate,
            revise the Statement of Purpose to make sure it accurately reflects the subcommittee's
            strengths and external regulatory, political, and economic opportunities. The ASG
            and subcommittee Co-Chairs will be sure everyone is aware of future revisions to

            On 23 September 2014, CCAC officially launched its <a target="_blank" href="http://www.unep.org/ccac/Initiatives/CCACOilGasInitiative/tabid/794015/Default.aspx">
                Oil & Gas Methane Partnership</a>. Six founding companies and key technical
            partners, including the U.S. EPA and State Department, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.edf.org/">
                Environmental Defense Fund</a>, and the United Kingdom's Department of Energy
            and Climate Change, were present at the launch, which was held at the <a target="_blank"
                href="http://www.un.org/climatechange/summit/">UN Secretary General's Climate Summit</a>
            in New York. Founding partners, four of whom are in the top 25 gas producers globally,
            are PEMEX of Mexico, ENI of Italy, Statoil of Norway, BG Group of the UK, PTT of
            Thailand, and Southwestern Energy of the United States. The International Energy
            Agency identifies minimizing methane emissions from upstream oil and gas production
            as one of four key global opportunities for greenhouse gas mitigation. The Oil &
            Gas Methane Partnership, which gives oil and gas companies a mechanism to address
            their methane emissions and disclose their actions to stakeholders and the public,
            was developed following a year-long consultation process conducted by CCAC.

            In July 2014, the U.S. EPA led a team of experts to Accra, Ghana, and Addis Ababa,
            Ethiopia, to provide technical and capacity building support on behalf of the CCAC's
            MSW Initiative. In Accra, the team met with the city government to discuss data
            collection efforts and the status of the CCAC work plan. The team also provided
            technical training to city officials and relevant stakeholders on landfill operations
            and LFG management, as part of a 3-day course on landfill design and operations.
            In Addis Ababa, the team (1) met with the city government to review the city's waste
            management priorities and current efforts; (2) observed waste management practices
            in operation and collected data on waste generation, collection, transportation,
            and disposal, in order to complete a CCAC City Assessment and SLCP emissions baseline
            estimation; and (3) met with key stakeholders to identify additional opportunities
            for collaboration and to secure support for current activities.</p>

            <br />
            Colombia, a GMI Partner Country, recently approved regulations for the promotion
            of methane use from mining operations that encourage the development of CMM and
            CBM. The two largest coal miners in Colombia, Cerrejon and Drummond, have <a target="_blank"

            <strong><i>Bulgaria Includes GMI Waste Sector Methane Action Plan in National Law</i></strong><br />
            Bulgaria's Ministry of Environment and Water, including former GMI MSW Subcommittee
            delegate Grigor Stoyanov, has developed a waste sector methane Action Plan for Bulgaria
            (view in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.globalmethane.org/activities/attachmentDownload.aspx?myObjId=00PG000000JS1gzMAD">
                Bulgarian</a> (PDF, 4pp, 68KB) and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.globalmethane.org/activities/attachmentDownload.aspx?myObjId=00PG000000JS1jnMAD">
                    English</a> (PDF, 4pp, 62KB)). The plan was recently incorporated in the
            country's National Solid Waste Management Program—the first time a GMI Action Plan
            has been adopted as part of a country's solid waste management law. It will provide
            a road map for the advancement of LFG recovery and use projects, outlining methane
            emission reduction goals and aligning mitigation opportunities across Bulgaria.

            <strong><i>World Bank Announces Pilot Auction Facility for Methane and Climate Mitigation</i></strong><br />
            The World Bank Group announced the launch of an innovative, pay-for-performance
            mechanism that uses auctions to allocate scarce public funds and attract private
            sector investment to projects that reduce methane emissions, taking advantage of
            the accounting methodologies and infrastructure already in place for implementation
            (e.g., methodologies and verification processes established under the Clean Development
            Mechanism).<br />
            <br />
            The key objective of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/climatechange/brief/pilot-auction-facility-methane-climate-mitigation">
                Pilot Auction Facility for Methane and Climate Mitigation</a> (PAF) is to demonstrate
            a new, cost-effective climate finance mechanism that incentivizes private sector
            investment and action in developing countries by providing a guaranteed floor price
            on carbon reduction credits.<br />
            <br />
            The first round of auctions under the PAF is expected in 2015.
