            Preparation and planning for Methane Expo 2013 has begun! This premier international
            forum is designed to promote the recovery and use of methane through new projects
            and technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Global Methane Initiative's (GMI's) Administrative Support Group (ASG) is <a
                href="../expo/sitevisit.html">requesting one-page abstracts</a> for presentations
            to be given at technical and policy sessions. Topics should be relevant to reducing
            global methane emissions, advancing the abatement, recovery, and use of methane
            as a clean energy source. Abstracts should focus on the GMI sectors: agriculture,
            coal mines, landfills, municipal wastewater systems, and oil and natural gas systems.
            The deadline to submit an abstract is <strong>29 June 2012</strong>.</p>

            Next March, <strong>Canada</strong>, a leader in GMI-related efforts, will host
            <a href="../expo/index.html">Methane Expo 2013</a> in Vancouver. Canada is strongly
            committed to working with its international partners to address climate change and
            methane-related international cooperation is a key way Canada is supporting effective
            international action in this area.</p>
        <p>
            Canada's participation as a GMI Partner Country stretches across multiple committees
            and sectors. In particular, Canada participates on the Steering Committee as well
            as the Agriculture, Municipal Solid Waste (previously known as the Landfill Subcommittee)
            and newly established Municipal Wastewater Subcommittees, and serves as Co-Chair
            of the Oil and Gas Systems Subcommittee. To date, Canada has hosted two GMI meetings;
            in September 2009 Canada hosted an <a href="event_detailsByEventId.aspx?eventId=3">Oil
                and Gas Systems Technology Transfer and Subcommittee Meeting</a> and in January
            2007, the country hosted an <a href="event_detailsByEventId.aspx?eventId=243">Energy
                Management Workshop for Upstream and Midstream Operations</a>.</p>
        <p>
            In the agricultural sector, Canadian livestock generate more than 200 million metric
            tons of manure each year, producing the methane equivalent of nearly 4 million metric
            tonnes of carbon dioxide. In response, Canada operates more than 16 operational
            anaerobic digester systems using farm and food industry biomass. The resulting biogas
            is used to provide on-site heat or electricity. Canada is also active in supporting
            GMI Partners and projects and has partnered with <strong>Mexico</strong> to study
            the applicability of robust low temperature anaerobic digester technologies to manage
            livestock manure. This joint research will determine site characteristics, design,
            and engineering specifications to implement an anaerobic digester on a swine farm
            on the Yucatan Peninsula and convert the biogas into clean energy and reuse manure
            nutrients to reduce the need for fossil fuel-based fertilizers.</p>
        <p>
            Canada is also working to reduce domestic methane emissions from landfills, which
            are estimated to produce approximately 27 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide
            equivalent annually. Sixty-four facilities across Canada recover landfill gas (LFG),
            reducing greenhouse gas emissions from landfills by 6.9 million metric tonnes of
            carbon dioxide equivalent annually. Beyond its borders, Canada is working with <strong>
                Colombia, Chile,</strong> and <strong>Mexico</strong> on various projects that
            offer a suite of options to divert organic matter from landfills and reduce methane
            emissions.</p>
        <p>
            Methane released from oil and natural gas systems represent almost half of Canada's
            total methane emissions. Canada is a world leader in reducing methane from oil and
            gas sector sources, implementing requirements to reduce venting and flaring. The
            province of Alberta has achieved over 50 percent reduction in venting of associated
            gas at crude oil and crude bitumen facilities between 2000 and 2010, although emissions
            since 2006 have begun to rise again due to significant increases in production of
            bitumen. Requirements to carry out methane leak detection and repair for equipment
            have been in place since 2010. The provinces of British Columbia and Saskatchewan
            are also taking action to reduce methane emissions from these sources.</p>
        <p>
            To help further address these emissions, Environment Canada and Natural Resources
            Canada were instrumental in the development of the <a href="../m2mtool/index.html">ON
                TIME Tool</a>, which displays interactive flow diagrams of oil and gas systems.
            The goal of the ON TIME Tool is to provide easy access to information on cost-effective
            technologies and practices that reduce emissions. Internationally, Canadian-funded
            projects in <strong>China</strong>, <strong>Colombia</strong>, and <strong>Mexico</strong>
            have helped to reduce fugitive methane emissions, decrease greenhouse gas externalities,
            improve energy efficiency, and conserve valuable non-renewable resources at the
            China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), Sinopec and the China National Offshore
            Oil Corporation (CNOOC), and GMI Partner organization Petr&oacute;leos Mexicanos
            (PEMEX), and EcoPetrol in Colombia.</p>
        <p>
            Since joining GMI in 2005, Canada has invested close to CAN$7.8 million in international
            projects that support the Initiative's goals of directly reducing or abating methane
            emissions. This investment was matched by more than $12 million in contributions
            from other public and private sector partners.</p>
        <p>
            Of this, two projects were recently supported using Canada's $1.2 billion <a href="http://www.faststartfinance.org/">
                Fast Start Financing</a> <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx" title="Exiting Global Methane Initiative">
                    <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>
            contribution, namely work to support the development of Nationally Appropriate Mitigation
            Actions (NAMAs) in the landfill and oil and gas sector. Canada is working with GMI
            Partner Countries Colombia, Chile, and Mexico to facilitate a strategic, inclusive
            and country-specific capacity building dialogue on methane mitigation and adaptation
            activities that support a shift towards clean renewable energy, energy efficiency,
            and energy security.</p>
        <p>
            Canada's fast-start financing is also supporting work related to GMI. For example,
            Canada is contributing CAN$1.9 million to support the <a href="http://cleancookstoves.org/">
                Global Alliance for Clean Cook Stoves</a> <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx" title="Exiting Global Methane Initiative">
                    <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>,
            an initiative that supports projects in <strong>Colombia, Ghana, Mexico,</strong>
            and <strong>Peru </strong>that will improve the health of families in those countries
            and reduce the climate warming impact of emissions of black carbon, including through
            the adoption of cook stoves that use biogas and LFG.</p>
        <p>
            Canada is also contributing CAN$3 million to support the new <a href="ne_slcf.aspx">
                Climate and Clean Air Coalition to Reduce Short-Lived Climate Pollutants (CCAC)</a>.
            This new initiative, of which Canada is a founding member, aims to reduce global
            emissions of pollutants such as black carbon, hydrofluorocarbons, and methane because
            of their near-term climate impacts as well as they impacts on air quality and human
            health.</p>
        <p>
            Canada is looking forward to hosting the GMI's Methane Expo 2013 and welcoming GMI
            official delegates in Vancouver!</p>

            their first Ministerial meeting on 24 April 2012 in <strong>Sweden</strong>. The
            Coalition, composed of 13 partners, is focused on reducing short-lived climate pollutants
            and has already established a trust fund with pledges totaling $18 million. Ministers
            approved five new rapid implementation initiatives targeted to accelerate action
            against climate-damaging emissions of black carbon, methane, and fluorinated gases
            (HFCs). Two of these &quot;fast track&quot; initiatives include improving solid
            waste management practices and reducing methane emissions from landfills and the
            reduction of methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. For more information,

            Plug Flow (Channel) Digesters Installed on Thai Pig Farms</h2>
        <p style="width: 300px; margin: 0 10px 10px 10px; padding: 5px; border: 1px solid #0076bf;

            Channel digester in Thailand.</p>
        <p>
            Thai officials are attempting to reverse the trend of rising agricultural emissions.
            In October 2011, Dr. Arux Chaiyakul, Senior Veterinarian Officer from the <strong>Thailand</strong>
            Department of Livestock Development, reported that Thailand reached its goal of
            installing anaerobic digesters to manage 240,000 pigs' worth of manure. With financial
            and technical support from GMI and the World Bank's Global Environmental Facility's
            (GEF's) International Waters Section and technical support from the Thailand Department
            of Livestock Development and the Thailand Energy Policy and Planning Office, non-traditional
            plug flow (channel) digester systems have been installed at 30 large swine farms
            in two provinces (Ratchuburi and Chnonburi) outside of Bangkok. These digesters
            were bundled under a Program of Activities (PoA) that allows small GHG emission
            sources such as livestock and food processing facilities to participate in carbon
            reduction programs. PoAs have also been jointly developed with the World Bank and
            GMI technical support in the Philippines.</p>
        <p>
            The participating farmers benefit from using the methane as an energy source and
            byproducts of the digestion process as fertilizer. Of special note is the dried
            solid fraction of the stabilized material which is bagged and sold to local farms.
            The approach is an excellent way to control non-point source pollution (NPS) without
            regulation. Moreover the revenues generated by the sale of stabilized solid waste
            exceed that of energy generation. The non-traditional plug flow (channel) digester
            was designed to add this benefit by including wet season solid storage and drying
            beds to facilitate processing and packaging. The PoA also has a community development
            component where 10 percent of the carbon payments are directed to poorer communities
            to develop clean water sources, malaria control, and educational opportunities.
            The digester systems also improve local water quality, reduce odors, and increase
            farm productivity. Thailand expects these GMI-supported projects to reduce methane
            emissions by 120,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. These non-traditional
            plug flow (channel) systems require a significant investment, so are designed for
            farms with at least 10,000 pigs. The World Bank's project team was awarded a first
            place standing in the SmartLessons competition where innovative programs that have
            resulted in positive impacts on development and environment were evaluated and scored
            by a panel. Last year, Thailand began an initiative to install less expensive tubular
            digester systems at 100 small farms and is considering bundling under a small-scale
            PoA, further reducing emissions from the country's more than 8.5 million pigs. This
            approach was transferred from the Philippines where GMI and the Land Bank of the
            Philippines work through pig cooperatives to expand the use of household digesters
            for cook fuel.</p>

            Sector Action Plans</h2>
        <p>
            Recently, many countries completed or updated their sector Action Plans. These plans
            are an important tool to identify the specific needs, opportunities, and priorities
            for project development. Countries write Action Plans in order to share what efforts
            have been undertaken, as well as to advance project development.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In February 2012, <strong>Turkey</strong> submitted its <a href="../documents/coal_cap_turkey.pdf">
                Coal Action Plan</a> (PDF, 5 pp, 302K), which outlines the opportunities to reduce
                methane emissions from the coal sector. Coal represents nearly 21 percent of Turkey's
                total power generation. The Action Plan also highlights Turkey's commitment in GMI,
                stemming from its two main interests of increasing mine safety by controlling mine
                methane and reducing GHG emissions by reducing methane emissions from their coal
                mines.</li>
            <li>In March 2012, <strong>Nicaragua</strong> completed its <a href="../documents/ag_cap_nicaragua.pdf">
                Agriculture Action Plan</a> (PDF, 12 pp, 831K) (Spanish only). In 2010, agricultural
                sources in Nicaragua accounted for nearly 30 percent of methane emissions in the
                country. The GHG emission sources used for the calculation include domestic livestock,
                enteric fermentation, manure management, rice cultivation, agricultural soils, prescribed
                burning of savannas, and field burning of agricultural waste. While there are still
                many barriers to project development, there are success stories that show the promise
                of projects in the country. For example, <a href="http://www.mcc.gov/">Millennium Challenge
                    Corporation</a> <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx" title="Exiting Global Methane Initiative">
                        <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>&mdash;an
                independent U.S. foreign aid agency&mdash;distributed thin plastic flat sheets to
                construct bag type digesters to farms in Le&oacute;n and Chinandega. They estimate
                that between 100 and 150 digesters are operating and converting swine waste into
                biogas. The Inter-American Development Bank, in conjunction with GMI, is also developing
                a PoA for small sources where technical support is provided by SNV. Farms are able
                to use the energy produced on-site as cooking fuel replacing biomass fuels and improving
                kitchen air quality and other health and environmental benefits such as reducing
                black carbon. Also in March 2012, Nicaragua completed their <a href="../documents/landfills_cap_nicaragua.pdf">
                    Landfill Action Plan</a> (PDF, 22 pp, 709K) (Spanish only). Nicaragua has 245
                municipal landfills and is promoting policies that help to regulate solid waste
                disposal, along with waste reduction and recycling. The U.S. EPA's Landfill Methane
                Outreach Program performed the first <a href="../activities/attachmentDownload.aspx?myObjId=00PG0000003i1VNMAY">
                    feasibility assessment</a> (PDF, 25 pp, 3.3 MB) in the country at La Chureca
                Landfill in Managua. The study concluded the site offers the opportunity to generate
                more than 1 megawatt (MW) of electricity. Nicaragua is hoping that other landfill
                owners will participate in feasibility studies after seeing the positive outcomes
                from the study at La Chureca.</li>
            <li>In April 2012, <strong>Ethiopia</strong> submitted their <a href="../activities/attachmentDownload.aspx?myObjId=00PG0000004Tj2xMAC">
                Landfill Action Plan</a> (PDF, 49 pp, 507K), which looked at solid waste management
                capacity and collection activities in the country, with an in-depth focus on three
                municipalities&mdash;Addis Ababa, Mekele, and Dire Dawa. The study concludes that
                although there is funding available for capital investment projects, there is a
                significant gap in resources for long-term technical capacity building and operations
                and maintenance of solid waste management systems. The Action Plan was designed
                to fit into both the national climate strategy known as Climate Resilient Green
                Economy Strategy (CRGE) and the economic plan known as the Growth and Transformation
                Plan (GTP). Together these strategies prioritize efforts to achieve a more carbon
                neutral future. One of the sectors prioritized in the plan includes the rapidly
                growing urban waste management sector, since emissions from urban solid waste are
                expected to rise over 200 percent by 2030. According to the GTP, there is an ambitious
                landfill construction goal that would bring improved municipal solid waste services
                to 364 towns and cities by 2015. Implementing improved LFG management techniques
                such as flaring has an annual abatement potential of 0.9 metric tons of carbon dioxide
                equivalent by 2030. The Landfill Action Plan adds value to the goals of the CRGE
                and GTP, by filling capacity gaps to reduce emissions from the growing urban solid
                waste management sector.</li>

            <strong><em>Australia</em></strong><br />
            In February 2012, Pamela Franklin (with the U.S. EPA's Coalbed Methane Outreach
            Program) traveled to Australia, where she attended several meetings and a conference.
            The trip began with a meeting at Geoscience Australia with participants from Partner
            organization Australia's Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism. This was followed
            by a roundtable discussion with representatives from GMI Partner organizations such
            as Australia's Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism; Department of Climate
            Change and Energy Efficiency; and Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research
            Organization. Topics discussed included Australia's GHG reporting program, treatment
            of abandoned mines, and water quality impacts from unconventional natural gas sources.
            Ms. Franklin finished the trip by attending the <a href="http://www.beaconevents.com/2012/CSGRISKSandRETURNS/en/Home/index.jsp">

        <p>
            <strong><em>Asia</em></strong><br />
            In January 2012, Kurt Roos, Team Leader of Agricultural Methane Programs at the
            U.S. EPA, traveled to Thailand to participate in the final mission for the Livestock
            Waste Management in East Asia (LWMEA) project. Funded by the GEF and implemented
            through the World Bank with technical assistance from GMI and the United Nations
            Food and Agricultural Organization, the project supported efforts in three countries&mdash;China,
            Thailand, and Vietnam&mdash;to address the negative environmental and health impacts
            of rapidly increasing livestock production. The project resulted in dozens of farm-scale
            projects and increased awareness and advanced progress toward better water quality
            and an effective policy framework that can be replicated in other countries. The
            project is currently being considered to expand to provincial-scale in Guangdong,
            China as a NPS program, which is similar to the Chesapeake Bay NPS program and is
            focused on a comprehensive agricultural sector approach that includes conservation
            agriculture such as integrating crops, livestock, and other high and low strength
            organic substrates.</p>
        <p>
            <strong><em>Europe</em></strong><br />
            On 16 March 2012, GMI traveled to Moscow, <strong>Russia</strong>, to meet with
            representatives from oil and gas companies, share resources, learn about oil and
            gas projects within Russia, introduce Russian companies to GMI and the U.S. EPA's
            Natural Gas STAR International, and discuss possible cooperation within the programs.
            There was also a workshop held at the Carnegie Moscow Center, which was co-hosted
            by the U.S. EPA, Pacific Northwest Laboratory, and World Wildlife Federation-Russia.
            The workshop focused on reducing methane emissions in the oil and natural gas sector.
            Representatives from Shell U.S. and Project Network member <a href="../project-network/pnmProfile.aspx?ID=a0AA0000002qfoaMAA">
                Hy-Bon Engineering Company</a> provided examples of practices used to identify

            Both companies stressed that, in addition to environmental benefits, the technologies
            they use can increase profits. Representatives from oil and natural gas companies,
            such as Gazprom VNIIGAZ, presented information on how companies flare and use associated
            gases, as well as data on emissions reduction.</p>

            On 15-16 May 2012, Tom Frankiewicz, Program Manager for the U.S. EPA Landfill Methane
            Outreach Program, traveled to Warsaw, <strong>Poland,</strong> to attend <a href="http://www.greenpowerconferences.com/EF/?sSubSystem=Prospectus&amp;sEventCode=BS1205PL&amp;sSessionID=693d030ba2457df58d5d6ef64c904e94-11109645">
                Biogas Poland 2012</a> <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx" title="Exiting Global Methane Initiative">
                    <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>.
            The conference focused on opportunities and challenges of biogas production at landfills,
            wastewater treatment plants, and agriculture biogas plants. Poland has set a goal
            that 14 percent of their energy production will come from renewable energy sources
            by 2020. Presentations included incentives to stimulate the industry, finance and
            investment for biogas projects, and agricultural biogas case studies. Mr. Frankiewicz
            spoke about opportunities and lessons learned through GMI. GMI also had a booth
            at the event where they shared information about the Initiative.</p>

            In March 2012, GMI attended <a href="http://2012.globeseries.com/">GLOBE 2012</a>
            <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx" title="Exiting Global Methane Initiative">
                <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>
            in Vancouver, <strong>Canada</strong>. The conference brought together more than
            9,000 representatives from the public, private, and non-governmental sectors with
            an interest in sustainability, energy, and the environment. The conference included
            discussions on the current trends and showcased innovative technologies for the
            world's environmental problems. GMI staff teamed up with Environment Canada, hosted
            a booth, and reached out to the private sector, Partner Countries, and Canadians
            to announce the upcoming GMI Methane Expo 2013. In preparation for Methane Expo
            2013, the ASG also met with the Canadian government as well as with organizations
            and representatives from British Columbia. In addition, they traveled to Nanaimo
            to visit a potential landfill site tour location for the Expo.</p>
