        <p>
            The Steering Committee has officially approved the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s application
            to become a member of GMI, bringing total participation in GMI to 42 countries and
            the European Commission. As the world’s second-largest producer of petroleum, Saudi
            Arabia will appoint members to the Oil and Gas Subcommittee to share their extensive
            experience with flare management and gas recovery. The country will pursue opportunities
            in methane capture and reuse projects, including flare management, fugitive emissions
            control from pipelines and tanks, and gas recovery and utilization.

        <p>
            The Australian government has developed a plan to tackle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
            while improving safety and economic viability in the coal mining sector through
            the <a href="http://www.uow.edu.au/content/groups/public/@web/@raid/documents/doc/uow133766.pdf">
                Coal Mining Abatement Technology Support Package (CMATSP)</a> (PDF). A total
            of $39 million will be spent in the first round of CMATSP funding over five years
            on technologies that demonstrate how to safely reduce fugitive methane emissions
            from coal mines (e.g., ventilation air methane capture methods). As part of the
            funding agreement, recipients are asked to share their experiences and develop best
            practices for GMI.</p>
        <p>

            (PDF), which was featured at GMI’s Methane Expo 2013 in Vancouver, Canada. The project,
            which is currently under development, connects a regenerative thermal oxidizer (RTO)
            directly to a mine ventilation fan to capture fan flow. When operational, it will
            reduce methane emissions from coal mines by at least 98 percent―the equivalent of
            approximately 360,500 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2e) annually.

            learned about member experiences developing NAMAs. Specifically, Canada has begun

                target="_blank">oil and gas NAMAs</a> covering key upstream, midstream and downstream
            facilities. So far, the collaboration has spanned baseline activity determination,
            quantification of emission reduction opportunities and business case development
            of significant “Mitigation Action” opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next steps for the subcommittee include developing implementation plans, extrapolating
            facility results to draft sector NAMAs, and registering NAMAs with the United Nations
            Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). All the meeting presenters recognized
            ongoing opportunities for collaboration to advance NAMA development with GMI and
            CCAC. The next in-person Subcommittee meeting will be co-located with the rescheduled

            of the site, surveyed plans for future expansion of the mine and discussed the feasibility
            of degassing the future expansion of mine workings through use of vertical pre-drainage
            wells and surface gob vent boreholes. DTEK is interested in utilizing the CMM for

            Programme (UNEP) initiative to address reductions of pollutants that are short-lived
            in the atmosphere (such has methane, black carbon, and hydrofluorocarbons) and are
            responsible for a substantial fraction of current global warming. CCAC continues
            to move forward on its efforts to reduce short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs)

            <li>Working with 10 major cities to complete work plans on mitigating SLCPs from the
                MSW sector, and implementation of those plans. CCAC has begun to plan for the expansion
                of its MSW work, which will eventually encompass an additional 10 to 15 cities.
            </li>
            <li>Supporting actions to reduce methane emissions from agriculture processes, particularly
                related to livestock and paddy rice production. </li>
            <li>Supporting additional countries in developing national action plans to reduce SLCPs.
                In 2013, CCAC focused capacity building efforts on Mexico, Ghana, Colombia, and

            India’s Central Mine Planning & Design Institute (CMPDI), held an international
            workshop on “Development of Coal Based Non-Conventional Energy Resources in India”
            from 12-13 November, 2013. Taking place next to the CMM/CBM Clearinghouse in Ranchi,
            the workshop’s aim was to disseminate information on the development of CBM/CMM
            resources in India, and to showcase development opportunities in CMM/CBM/VAM projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            The workshop was well-attended by almost 150 top governmental officials, international
            technical experts, CBM project operators, academics and research organizations.
            Topics of discussion related to CMM/CBM/VAM included policy issues, emerging technologies,
            research trends, opportunities and challenges. U.S. EPA CMOP’s Dr. Jayne Somers,
            along with Jon Kelafant (ARI), represented GMI’s coal sector at the workshop. They
            gave presentations at the plenary session on GMI’s latest activities, especially
            in relation to India, plus new developments in methane drainage. Visit the <a href="http://cmmclearinghouse.cmpdi.co.in/proceedingsNov13.php"
