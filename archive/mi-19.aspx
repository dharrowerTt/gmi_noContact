            Methane to Markets' Projects in the Spotlight</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="/images/mi19_chinaspotlight.jpg" alt="" align="right" />Many methane
            capture and use projects have gone from concept to reality in the short time Methane
            to Markets has been operational. Now you can read all about them on the <a href="../projects/projects_index.aspx">
                Partnership's website</a>. Highlighted at the <a href="../expo_india10/index.htm">2010 Partnership
                    Expo</a>, these project spotlights include agriculture, coal mines, and
            landfill projects from <a href="../partners/brazil.aspx">Brazil</a>, <a href="../partners/china.aspx">
                China</a>, <a href="../partners/india.aspx">India</a>, and <a href="../partners/ukraine.aspx">
                    Ukraine</a>. All have been completed and are helping to reduce emissions
            by more than 6 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent annually. One of
            the projects, the <a href="../projects/projects_china2.aspx">Datong mine project</a>,
            located in the Chongqing Municipality in Southwest China, will destroy ventilation
            air methane (VAM) with methane oxidization technology. The heat generated during
            oxidization will be used to produce hot water for coal mine workers. Another project,
            <a href="../projects/projects_brazil2.aspx">Frigor&iacute;fico Mabella</a>, a nine-year-old
            pork processing, swine production, and trading company in the Matto Grosso province
            of Brazil, will be using biogas to provide electricity to the farm. Read more about
            these and other exciting methane capture and use projects on the <a href="../projects/projects_index.aspx">

                align="right" />Argentina's <a href="http://www.ars.org.ar/">Solid Waste Association
                    (ARS)</a> <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx" title="Exiting Global Methane Initiative">
                        <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>
            has been working for the past three years to develop a pilot-scale project that
            recovers landfill gas (LFG) and uses it to fuel infrared heaters. In 2007, ARS received
            a <a href="../projects/projectdetail.aspx?id=214">Methane to Markets grant</a> for
            $125,000 from the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>
            <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx" title="Exiting Global Methane Initiative">
                <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>
            to create a project that uses LFG to fulfill onsite energy needs. ARS selected the
            Escobar Landfill in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to be the site of the project. Currently,
            the Escobar Landfill has an operational LFG project where an infrared heater uses
            15 standard cubic feet of LFG per minute to supply onsite energy needs. By substituting
            LFG for a fossil fuel, ARS calculated that the net avoidance of greenhouse gas emissions
            will be nearly 515 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. In addition,
            the project will yield local air quality improvements by reducing local greenhouse
            gas emissions. When the heaters are not in use, the landfill will flare the LFG.</p>

            Landfill Gas Workshop</h2>
        <p>
            On 2 June 2010, landfill owners and managers, government officials, project developers,
            and project financiers will meet in Buenos Aires, Argentina, for a workshop on the
            basics of LFG projects. Entitled &quot;Creating Viable LFG-to-Energy Project in
            Latin America,&quot; the workshop will provide an overview of the landfill sector,
            explain LFG-to-energy systems, and review the basics of project planning. Speakers
            will share strategies to bring a landfill online as well as insights into project
            design and financing. Representatives from Methane to Markets Partner Countries
            will present specific opportunities and project models for landfill methane capture
            and use in Latin America, as well as financing and incentive programs. The workshop
            will be held after the <a href="https://www.iswa.org/nc/en/185/iswa_calendar/eventdetail/show_detail/iswa-beacon-conference-on-engineered-landfills.html">

                <strong>Methane to Markets Included in New Draft Senate Climate Bill</strong></p>
            <p>
                On 12 May 2010, U.S. Senators John Kerry and Joe Lieberman released a draft of a
                climate change and energy bill, entitled the <a href="http://lieberman.senate.gov/assets/pdf/APA_full.pdf">
                    American Power Act</a> (PDF, 987 pp., 1.7 MB) <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx" title="Exiting Global Methane Initiative">
                        <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>.
                The bill would place emissions limits on approximately 7,500 U.S. factories and
                power plants whose operations emit more than 25,000 tons of greenhouse gases each
                year.</p>
            <p>
                The bill includes methane collection from mines, landfills, and natural gas systems,
                as well as manure management and anaerobic digesters, in the initial list of eligible
                project types for domestic emission reduction offsets. The bill also recognizes
                the important work of the U.S. EPA and other U.S. government agencies to promote
                international methane reductions through such programs as the Methane to Markets
                Partnership.</p>

                from China's coal mines, which could develop into a near $1 billion industry once
                market incentives are established. AES plans to build up to 25 VAM projects by 2017.
                AES' first VAM project is at the Datong Coal Mine in Chongqing municipality, which
                was <a href="../Data/new_UPDATE_Coal_CN_ChongqingVAM_Poster.pdf">showcased</a> (PDF,
                3 pp., 1.5MB) at the 2010 Partnership Expo. The project, once fully operational,
                will be one of the first commercially operating facilities of its kind in China.
                AES' methane-capturing projects are registered with the United Nations to qualify
                as Clean Development Mechanism projects encouraged under the Kyoto climate pact.<br />
