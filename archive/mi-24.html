            Subcommittee Updates</h2>
        
        <p>
            The Global Methane Initiative's (GMI's) Administrative Support Group (ASG) convened
            all four subcommittees via webinars earlier this month. This was the ASG's first
            use of virtual meetings to encourage greater participation by both delegates and
            Project Network members. Webinar participants are encouraged to contact <a href="../asg.aspx">
                ASG or Subcommittee chairs</a> with opinions on the success of the webinars.</p>
        <p>
            Additionally, the ASG provided an update on new Partner Countries and discussed
            draft guidance that was recently distributed for development of GMI Partner Action
            Plans (see <em><a href="#four">Moving Forward with GMI Partner Action Plans</a></em>).
            Details for each webinar are highlighted below.</p>
        <p>
            <strong><em>Agriculture</em></strong><br />
            The GMI Agriculture Subcommittee meeting took place on 14 June 2011. The webinar
            was attended by nearly 20 participants, with several applauding the webinar format.
            Topics discussed included an update on international collaboration and the availability
            of the Agriculture Subcommittee Co-Chair position. Additionally, the international
            database of anaerobic digestion systems was discussed; it is anticipated to go online
            later this year. Other agenda items included possible future work of the Subcommittee
            and ideas to increase country and Project Network participation, including a potential
            webinar on ways Project Network members can better participate in GMI.</p>

        <p>
            <strong><em>Landfills</em></strong><br />
            The Landfill Subcommittee met on 1 June 2011. The webinar, attended by nearly 30
            participants, included a discussion of the new outreach activities that promote
            the expanded GMI scope of methane abatement and wastewater sectors. In addition
            to these administrative updates, each delegate identified their priority methane
            abatement technologies (e.g., composting, anaerobic digestion, and waste-to-energy)
            and ongoing or planned abatement activities in their country, as well as a needs
            assessment (e.g., development of abatement technology white papers or fact sheets).
            This information will be used to tailor the scope of the subcommittee and to develop
            a guidance document to help countries evaluate appropriate technologies.</p>
        <p>
            In closing, the Co-Chairs updated delegates on recent outreach activities planned
            for the wastewater sector and solicited volunteers to assist with peer review of
            the International Landfill Gas Project Best Practices Guide. The U.S. Co-Chair announced
            that U.S. EPA will soon issue a new call for proposals for its annual GMI grant
            solicitation and anticipates an expanded scope to include wastewater, abatement
            capacity building, site assessments, and inventories in GMI Partner Countries.</p>

        <p>
            <strong><em>Oil and Gas</em></strong><br />
            The Oil and Gas Subcommittee met on 15 June 2011 and was attended by nearly 20 participants.
            Partner Countries <strong>Canada, India, Mexico,</strong> and the <strong>United States</strong>
            provided brief updates on relevant activities in which they had been involved since
            the last Subcommittee meeting. These updates included a discussion of issues or
            barriers preventing methane emission reduction projects in their country. Participants
            also discussed how their country engages in other international initiatives, seeking
            to describe how GMI fits within a country's priorities and how it could be improved
            to meet their needs. There was initial discussion with Subcommittee and Project
            Network members to identify a work product that members would be willing to develop
            and support. This topic will be discussed further at the next Subcommittee meeting.</p>
        <p>
            The ASG presented their ideas on the next Subcommittee meeting format and solicited
            ideas for the technical and policy sessions. Several potential agenda topics were
            put forth during the webinar. Everyone is encouraged to send topics of interest
            for discussion at the next meeting to the ASG at <a href="mailto:secretariat@globalmethane.org">

                Related GMI Efforts in Brazil</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="../partners/brazil.aspx">Brazil</a>, a GMI charter member since 2004, has
                several ongoing GMI efforts to capture and use LFG. In April, Chris Godlove, a GMI
                representative from U.S. EPA, travelled to Brazil to meet local officials, learn
                about specific projects, and research potential applications for landfill technologies.
                In June, he also spoke at the International Seminar on Sustainable Wastewater Treatment
                Operation, held in Brazil. The <a href="../documents/events_land_20110601_godlove_sp.pdf">
                    presentation</a> (Spanish only) (PDF, 26 pp, 1.1 MB) included details from a
                paper recently released on wastewater technologies.</p>
            <p>
                Similarly, the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, a 2009
                GMI grant recipient, is continuing its work to create a regulatory toolkit that
                will foster the adoption of LFG recovery and use within the Brazilian waste sector.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            <em><strong>Brazil Develops Community-Based LFG Projects</strong></em><br />
            In 2009, a team from Appalachian State University (ASU) Energy Center, a multi-disciplinary
            program in Boone, North Carolina, <strong>United States</strong> that conducts energy
            research and activities, began looking for rural communities outside the United
            States that would benefit from their experience and strategies for sustainable economic
            development. With funding from a 2009 GMI grant, a team led by Stan Steury and Jeff
            Ramsdell began collaborating with local officials in the arid northeast region of
            Cear&aacute;, <strong>Brazil</strong> to identify sites well suited for community-based
            landfill gas (LFG) economic development opportunities. While most cities ship their
            garbage out of view, some Brazilians make a living combing through landfills to
            find recyclables to sell. With a statewide population of 8.4 million people and
            approximately 12,000 catadores (&quot;waste pickers&quot;), Cear&aacute; is no exception.</p>
        <p>
            The team from ASU began to research the potential for recovering LFG, focusing on
            energy and community needs. ASU faculty and students brought hands-on experience
            from facilitating community-based LFG energy projects in rural communities within
            North Carolina. ASU believed that rural areas in Brazil could also benefit from
            their experience in utilizing LFG as an inexpensive and clean source of local energy.
            Both share the need for cheap and reliable energy sources to provide jobs, economic
            opportunities for small businesses, improved quality of life, and environmental
            protection.
        </p>
        <p>
            The timing of the project is ideal, as government officials in Cear&aacute; aim
            to transition toward sanitary landfills. The ASU team toured seven landfills for
            potential economic development opportunities. Based on the potential for LFG projects
            and interest by local officials, the team selected the Maracana&uacute; Landfill
            as their pilot project for LFG development. Based upon preliminary models, the landfill
            is estimated to reduce 56,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO<sub>2</sub>E)
            per year, as well as produce 850 cubic meters per hour of LFG, with the potential
            for more as waste is added. During their time in Brazil, the team formed close relationships
            with local officials, five of whom visited North Carolina in June 2010 to tour successful
            LFG energy projects.</p>

        <p>
            <strong>Technology Transfer to Catadores</strong><br />
            At the Maracana&uacute; Landfill, the collection and trade of recyclable materials
            supports 75 families. After seeing the area and meeting the local people, the ASU
            team felt that assisting the catadores was an important goal. In addition to the
            LFG benefits, the project hopes to earn revenue from the sale of recycled materials
            as well as the sale of carbon credits. To help raise funds, ASU students collected
            more than $2,000 from a showing of <a href="http://www.wastelandmovie.com/"><em>Waste
                Land</em></a> <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx" title="Exiting Global Methane Initiative">
                    <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>,
            a documentary film about the artist Vik Muniz, to give to the catadores. The film
            shows the life of catadores at Jardim Gramacho, the world's largest landfill located
            outside Rio de Janeiro, where nearly 3,000 catadores pick 200 tons of recyclable
            materials every day.</p>
        <p>
            Throughout the process, GMI staff has provided technical support to overcome hurdles.
            The ASU team has developed a conceptual plan for a sorting facility in Cear&aacute;,
            using technology that is inexpensive, dependable, and easily maintained and repaired.
            For example, a modified automobile engine may be used to generate electricity, instead
            of a large reciprocating engine, to ensure access to spare parts as well as local
            repair expertise. In addition to using the LFG for electricity, the project in Maracana&uacute;
            is exploring industrial uses, such as a plastic manufacturing facility, using recycled
            materials collected by the &ldquo;catadores.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>
            U.S. EPA anticipates that it will be able to provide funding to ASU to complete
            the second phase of planning and design, as well as to investigate the potential
            for other solid waste management systems. In addition to this, ASU is seeking other
            funds to construct the LFG collection system. By transferring personal expertise
            as well as technology, the team from ASU hopes they can deliver sustainable business
            options to turn garbage into a revenue stream for local residents. For more information,

            Moving Forward with GMI Partner Action Plans</h2>
        <p>
            In October 2010, the Steering Committee agreed on the need for overarching GMI Partner
            Action Plans and tasked the ASG with developing guidance. As stated in the <a href="../about/terms.aspx">
                Terms of Reference</a>, &quot;Action plans can be useful tools in advancing
            project implementation, facilitating investment, and creating appropriate policy
            frameworks that support methane abatement, recovery, and use.&quot; The goals of
            the GMI Partner Action Plans include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Articulating the overall vision for a Partner's participation in GMI.</li>
            <li>Outlining key country activities and priorities.</li>
            <li>Providing a mechanism to advance cooperation between Partners by identifying needs
                and opportunities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            GMI is hopeful that the development of Partner Action Plans will help drive current
            and future project development activity in all four sectors. The ASG distributed
            draft guidance to all country delegates for review&mdash;and is now compiling comments
            with a goal of providing final guidance for Steering Committee approval at the October
            Steering meeting in Krakow, Poland. If you are a delegate and did not receive this

        <p>
            On 20 May 2011, Mexican officials, including the President of <strong>Mexico</strong>,
            celebrated the opening of an LFG utilization project at the Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez
            Landfill in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico. The project, supported by GMI, will
            reduce greenhouse gas emissions by capturing the methane and using it to generate
            electricity that will feed into the national power grid. The project provides a
            model for a sustainable approach for governments to better manage landfills and
            comply with environmental standards. Another benefit was the employment opportunities
            generated from its construction and in the operation and maintenance of the system.</p>

            Below are a few activities GMI has been engaged in to promote methane use and recovery.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In April 2011, GMI attended the <a href="event_detailsByEventId.aspx?eventId=328">
                International Workshop on Methane Emissions Reduction Technologies in the Oil and
                Natural Gas Industry</a> in Huadong, <strong>China</strong>. The event was hosted
                by China University of Petroleum (Huadong), U.S. EPA, and RTI International. The
                workshop focused on methane emissions from the production, processing, and transmission
                of oil and natural gas. Topics discussed at the event included an overview of methane
                emissions in the oil and natural gas industry, methane leak detection technologies,

                    <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>
                in Moscow, <strong>Russia.</strong> The event was organized by the International
                Solid Waste Association (ISWA) and SIBICO International Ltd. The conference brought
                together solid waste managers, practitioners, operators, policy-makers, manufacturers,
                vendors, and other specialists. Session 4 of the conference, sponsored by GMI, focused
                on experience in LFG extraction and utilization technology applications. Presenters
                from Partner Countries such as <strong>Germany</strong>, Russia, and <strong>Ukraine</strong>
                discussed current solid waste management and LFG recovery projects and future initiatives
                in Eastern Europe.</li>
            <li>In May 2011, GMI helped sponsor and participated in the <a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/BANCOMUNDIAL/EXTSPPAISES/LACINSPANISHEXT/MEXICOINSPANISHEXT/0,,contentMDK:22917586~menuPK:500926~pagePK:64027988~piPK:64027986~theSitePK:500870,00.html">
                Gas Flaring and Venting Measurement Workshop</a> <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx"
                    title="Exiting Global Methane Initiative">
                    <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>
                in Villa Hermosa, <strong>Mexico.</strong> The workshop provided information on
                Pemex's Strategic Flare/Vent/Fugitives Measurement Plan and the newly formed Grupos
                de Medici&oacute;n. Also covered during the workshop were the current best practices
                on measuring gas flare and fugitive volumes, as well as key constraints and considerations
                when selecting flare measurement systems for both new and existing flaring and fugitive
                installations.</li>
            <li>In May 2011, Monica Shimamura, co-director of GMI's ASG, met with the two Agriculture
                Subcommittee Co-Chairs, Anil Dhussa, from <strong>India's</strong> Ministry of New
                and Renewable Energy and Jorge Hilbert from <strong>Argentina's</strong> INTA, as
                well as Allison Costa from U.S. EPA's AgSTAR Program. The meeting took place at
                the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/agstar/news-events/events/conference11.html">Sixth AgSTAR
                    National Conference</a> <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx" title="Exiting Global Methane Initiative">
                        <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>
                on 10-12 May 2011 in Idaho, <strong>United States.</strong> The purpose of the meeting
                was to develop a strategy to increase subcommittee participation and collaboration
                between the Partner Countries. Several outcomes were achieved by the meeting, including
                the realization for the need to develop projects for joint collaboration for the
                subcommittee members and the need for the ASG to find new ways to engage delegates.
                Another benefit of this meeting during the AgSTAR Conference was that both Mr. Dhussa
                and Mr. Hilbert were able to learn more about the U.S. anaerobic digester industry
                and network with U.S. businesses.</li>

                Mayoral Training Event</a> (Chinese only) <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx" title="Exiting Global Methane Initiative">
                    <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>
                in Beijing, <strong>China.</strong> The training is one of many such courses held
                by the National Academy for Mayors of China, which is an institution under GMI Partner
                organization the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of China. Attended
                by nearly 50 mayors from cities throughout China, the event focused on solid waste
                management technologies and integrated solid waste management approaches, including
                LFG energy, anaerobic digesters, and municipal waste combustion. As part of the
                training, there was a site visit to the <a href="../projects/projectDetail.aspx?ID=132">
                    Gaoantun Landfill</a>, where in 2007 GMI conducted a pump test at the landfill
                and prepared a pre-feasibility study based on site-specific landfill data.</li>
            <li>In June 2011, GMI attended the <a href="http://www.carbonexpo.com/portal/appmanager/efiraSalones/S093011?_nfpb=true&amp;_windowLabel=T93000116201300813109470&amp;T93000116201300813109470_actionOverride=%2Fportlets%2Ffol%2FPressRelease%2FdetailPressRelease&amp;T93000116201300813109470_Id=13724">

                New Partnership Supports GMI in the Solid Waste Sector</h2>
            <p>
                On 1 June 2011, U.S. EPA and ISWA launched a joint effort to collaborate on public
                health, climate, and energy issues as outlined in a <a href="http://op.bna.com/env.nsf/id/mwis-8hgq2r/$File/Methane%20Agreement.pdf">
                    Memorandum of Understanding</a> (PDF, 6 pp, 86 KB) <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx"

                        <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>.
                The announcement was made during the &quot;Solid Waste Treatment and Disposal: Leading
                Edge Technologies&quot; conference in <strong>Russia.</strong> EPA's partnership
                with ISWA will allow increased access to professional networks and technical expertise,

            <li><strong>World Bank Agreement Will Help Cities Control Climate Change</strong>. On
                1 June 2011, Project Network member the <a href="../project-network/pnmProfile.aspx?ID=34">
                    World Bank</a> signed an agreement with mayors from 40 of the world's biggest
                cities to focus on technical and financial assistance for projects to minimize the
                effects of climate change. This agreement was announced at the <a href="http://www.c40cities.org/events/">
                    C40 S&atilde;o Paulo Summit</a> <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx" title="Exiting Global Methane Initiative">
                        <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>
                held in <strong>Brazil</strong>.<strong> </strong>As part of the mutual agreement,
                the participants will establish:<strong></strong></li>
            <li>A consistent approach to climate action plans and strategies to enable stronger
                partnerships and to permit potential investors to identify opportunities across
                cities.</li>
            <li>A common approach to measuring and reporting on city greenhouse gas emissions to
                allow verifiable and consistent monitoring of emissions reductions, identify actions
                that result in the greatest emission reductions, and facilitate access to carbon
                finance. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The development of a standard approach for developing action plans and protocols
            for quantified emission reductions will reduce obstacles for cities to access funding
            to implement greenhouse gas emission reduction activities. Former U.S. President
            Bill Clinton applauded the agreement and provided as an example that capturing methane
            from landfills as a power source &quot;would solve a public health problem, give
            massive amounts of land back to cities...[and] would put huge numbers of people
            back to work.&quot;</p>

            <li><strong>Global Legislators Organisation Releases Legislation Study.</strong> In
                April 2011, the Globe Legislators Organisation for a Balanced Environment, also
                known as GLOBE International, partnered with the Grantham Research Institute on
                Climate Change at the London School of Economics to produce the <a href="http://www.globeinternational.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/GLOBE-CLIMATE-LEGISLATION-STUDY.pdf">
                    <em>GLOBE Climate Legislation Study</em></a> (PDF, 276 pp, 2.4 MB) <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx"

                        <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>.
                The study looks into the status of climate change legislation in 16 of the world's
                largest economies, 13 of which are GMI Partner Countries. It shows that climate
                change is being addressed through legislation in all of the countries covered by
                this study. Although the approach differs, due to national priorities and circumstances,
                the overall goal of legislation in the countries is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
                and prepare each country for the impacts of climate change.</li>
