            year's event will be the world's largest forum for methane projects, technology,
            financing, and policy.</p>
        <p>
            India's Minister of Environment and Forests and Member of the Indian Parliament,
            Shri Jairam Ramesh, will deliver the Expo keynote address on 3 March 2010. Mr. Ramesh
            is a widely respected political figure and author of a number of government policies
            in India's environment, energy, and industrial sectors. He has played a key role
            representing India at international climate negotiations.</p>
        <p>
            The Expo's Methane Marketplace will be bustling in New Delhi. In an unprecedented
            display of enthusiasm for methane capture opportunities, the Methane Marketplace
            will be featuring more than 140 project opportunities and success stories in all
            sectors from more than 20 countries.</p>

            <img src="/images/mi17_part_cover.gif" class="right" alt="Partnership Accomplishments Report Cover" />Methane
            to Markets has completed its fifth year. To mark this milestone, the ASG compiled
            the first Methane to Markets <em><a href="../documents/par_110609.pdf">Partnership Accomplishments
                2004-2009</a></em> (PDF, 52 pp, 2.6 MB) report. This report documents the Partnership's
            growth from 14 Partners in 2004 to 31 in 2009 and details the Partnership's successes.
            It summarizes Partner and Project Network member collaboration on more than 170
            methane capture and use projects and activities. The report provides details on
            80 events held by the Partnership in 23 countries, as well as Partnership activities
            that generated $84 million in direct project funding and leveraged an additional
            $350 million in private financing for capacity building and project development.
            It also illustrates how Methane to Markets' projects have not only led to a reduction
            of 27 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent annually, but also fostered
            international collaboration on important climate and energy developments.</p>

            Almost $4 Million in Grants Awarded to International Methane Projects</h2>
        <p>
            At the end of 2009 and beginning of 2010, the U.S. EPA awarded $3.9 million in funding
            to support methane capture and use projects and stimulate clean energy development
            across all four Methane to Markets sectors. <a href="http://www.epa.gov/methanetomarkets/grants09.htm">
                Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, China, Colombia, India, Mexico, Nigeria, Philippines,
                Poland, and Russia received the awards</a> <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx" title="Exiting Global Methane Initiative">
                    <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>,
            ranging from $20,000 to $700,000. The projects will include training and capacity
            building, development of databases and information clearinghouses for potential
            sites, feasibility studies, technology transfer, and project expositions. Since
            the Partnership began five years ago, the U.S. EPA has awarded nearly $13 million
            in grants to 70 methane emission reduction projects.</p>
        <h2 id="three">
            Grant Funding Available for Methane Projects in 2010 &ndash; 15 April Deadline!</h2>
        <p>
            Continuing its commitment to support projects that reduce methane emissions, the
            <a href="http://www.epa.gov/methanetomarkets/grants.htm">U.S. EPA announced a new round
                of grant funding for Methane to Markets projects</a>. Up to 35 projects are
            anticipated to receive grants ranging from $100,000 to $750,000, with an estimated
            total award of $5 million.</p>
        <p>
            Successful proposals will support the Partnership's goals of reducing methane emissions
            and advancing project development in the following Methane to Markets Partner countries:
            Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Georgia,
            India, Kazakhstan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Mongolia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines,
            Poland, Russia, Thailand, Ukraine, and Vietnam. Additionally, the U.S. EPA is accepting
            proposals from developing countries or countries with economies in transition that
            are in the process of <a href="../participate/countrypartners.aspx">applying to join
                the Partnership</a>, as long as the ASG receives an acceptable letter of intent
            before the proposal deadline. Funded projects are scheduled to begin in October
            2010 and extend for up to three years. The U.S. EPA must receive applications no
            later than 15 April 2010. Visit the U.S. EPA's <a href="http://www.epa.gov/methanetomarkets/grants.htm">

            ushered out 2009 and ushered in 2010 with numerous landfill gas (LFG) workshops
            and site visits in both Partner and non-Partner countries. These events included
            the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Methane to Markets participated in LFG workshops and landfill site visits in Ukraine
                and Russia. In Khmelnitsky and Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine, Methane to Markets representatives
                assisted with workshops focusing on LFG project operations and management for landfill
                operators at municipal facilities. In Moscow, organizers held a workshop for municipal
                officials, energy developers, and landfill owners to learn about LFG and potential
                LFG energy projects. Representatives from the Methane to Markets Partnership also
                met with environmental officials in Novokuznetsk, Russia, to discuss ongoing cooperation
                on Methane to Markets efforts in the agriculture, coal, and landfill sectors.</li>
