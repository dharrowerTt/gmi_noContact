            A New Look for the Global Methane Initiative</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="/images/gmi.gif" alt="GMI logo" /></p>
        <p>
            Building on momentum surrounding the recent <a href="../gmi/index.aspx">Global Methane
                Initiative (GMI)</a> launch, the <a href="../asg.aspx">Administrative Support Group
                    (ASG)</a> recently unveiled a new &quot;look&quot; to brand and unify GMI's
            website and materials. The new look is built around a refurbished logo, which features
            the methane flame and sun rays, a new beginning for the program and methane's far-reaching
            potential for global change.</p>
        <div style="width: 280px; margin: 5px 0 10px 15px; padding: 5px; border: 1px solid #0076bf;

                <img src="/images/mi20_mexicocity.jpg" alt="" style="float: right;" />At the second
                Ministerial Meeting in Mexico City on 1 October 2010, more than 65 participants
                from 20 countries as well as the Asian Development Bank and Inter-American Development
                Bank unanimously approved the creation of <a href="../documents/gmi_factsheet.pdf">GMI</a>
                (PDF, 2 pp, 114 KB). Led by Mexico's Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources
                Juan Rafael Elvira Quesada and U.S. Environmental Protect Agency's (EPA's) Office
                of Air and Radiation Assistant Administrator and Steering Committee Chair Gina McCarthy,
                the Partner delegations adopted a <a href="../documents/gmi_ministerial.pdf">Ministerial
                    Declaration</a> (PDF, 2 pp, 20 KB), urging stronger international action to
                address near-term climate change.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            The ASG is redesigning many Partnership materials to reflect this new look. The
            former Methane to Markets website has now migrated to a new address: <a href="../index.aspx">
                www.globalmethane.org</a>. While this site has the same navigation and content
            as the previous site, it also features GMI's new logo and a dedicated GMI page,
            <a href="../gmi/index.aspx">www.globalmethane.org/gmi</a>, and refreshed fact sheets
            that highlight the Partnership's successes to date and GMI's newly expanded program
            areas (e.g., abatement, wastewater).</p>
        <p>
            With these improvements in place, GMI is ready to move forward and fulfill its mission.
            Central to its progress are financial commitments from developed-country Partners
            and others to address climate change through GMI's methane mitigation efforts. The
            United States is pledging $50 million over the next five years to support methane
            emissions reduction projects and technologies, and other developed-country Partners
            are considering similar pledges.</p>

            Subcommittees Met in November</h2>
        <p>
            Three of the subcommittees and the Wastewater Taskforce convened in November to
            continue their collaboration and discuss outcomes from the Ministerial meeting including
            the implementation of GMI. Some of the details from these meeting are listed below.</p>
        <div style="width: 280px; margin: 5px 0 10px 15px; padding: 5px; border: 1px solid #0076bf;

            <p style="text-align: center;">
                <strong>Wastewater Taskforce</strong></p>
            <p>
                The <a href="event_detailsByEventId.aspx?eventId=296">Wastewater Taskforce</a> met
                concurrently with the Landfill and Agriculture Subcommittee meetings to focus on
                how best to fit wastewater into the Initiative. The taskforce discussed three options:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Formation of a new Wastewater Subcommittee</li>
                <li>The inclusion of wastewater within the Landfill Subcommittee</li>
                <li>Holding wastewater meetings in conjunction with the Landfill and Agriculture Subcommittee
                    meetings</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The Taskforce agreed that these options should be included in a new wastewater whitepaper
                that will be prepared for the Steering Committee along with an estimate of the financial
                commitments that might be required for each option.</p>
            <p>
                In addition, GMI is looking for countries that are interested in initiating activities
                in the wastewater sector. Please <a href="mailto:secretariat@globalmethane.org">contact the
                    ASG</a> if your country would like to be included.</p>

            <strong><em>Oil and Gas Subcommittee</em></strong><br />
            On 3 November 2010, the <a href="event_detailsByEventId.aspx?eventId=284">Oil and Gas
                Subcommittee</a> met in New Orleans, Louisiana. The meeting was held in conjunction
            with the U.S. EPA's <a href="http://www.epa.gov/gasstar/workshops/annualimplementation/2010.html">
                Natural Gas STAR Annual Implementation Workshop</a> <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx"

                    <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>
            on 1-3 November 2010. The workshop included a tour of a local natural gas plant
            and the U.S. EPA's Natural Gas STAR Annual Implementation Workshop and Award Ceremony.</p>
        <p>
            The meeting attracted the largest turnout to date: 32 participants from five countries,
            many attending their first Subcommittee meeting. Francisco Sucre of the <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/">
                World Bank</a> <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx" title="Exiting Global Methane Initiative">
                    <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>
            presented on the bank's carbon finance and technical networks. Participants also
            had a chance to discuss the future of GMI. In addition, the Subcommittee decided
            by consensus that the leadership would remain in place for now. The next <a href="../oil-gas/index.aspx">
                Oil and Gas Subcommittee</a> meeting will be held in mid-2011, but its location
            has not yet been determined.</p>
        <p>
            <strong><em>Landfill Subcommittee</em></strong><br />
            On 11 November 2010, the <a href="event_detailsByEventId.aspx?eventId=295">Landfill
                Subcommittee</a> met in Venice, Italy along with the <a href="event_detailsByEventId.aspx?eventId=297">

        <p>
            Participants discussed charges given to the subcommittees from the recent Steering
            Committee, the transition from Methane to Markets to GMI, and how the landfill sector
            can contribute to the initiative's new wastewater focus.</p>
        <p>
            <strong><em>Agriculture Subcommittee</em></strong><br />
            On 12 November 2010, the <a href="event_detailsByEventId.aspx?eventId=297">Agriculture
                Subcommittee</a> met in Venice, Italy. The Subcommittee discussed the outcomes
            of the Methane to Markets Ministerial meeting and the direction provided by the
            Steering Committee. The Subcommittee also shared country updates and information
            about the recently conducted Resource Assessments. The Subcommittee emphasized the
            importance of countries creating and maintaining action plans and up-to-date reporting.</p>
        <p>
            In addition, the Subcommittee announced that Jeremy Eppel of the <a href="http://ww2.defra.gov.uk/">

            <img src="/images/mi22_cover.jpg" alt="" style="float: left; margin: 0 15px 10px 0;" />The
            U.S. EPA recently released the fifth annual <a href="http://www.epa.gov/methanetomarkets/accompreport.htm">
                <em>U.S. Government's Methane to Markets Partnership Accomplishments</em></a>
            <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx" title="Exiting Global Methane Initiative">
                <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>
            report, documenting the leadership efforts of the U.S. federal government to reduce
            and recover methane around the world. In 2009, EPA continued its collaborative efforts
            with the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Agency for International Development,
            the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the U.S.
            Trade and Development Agency to support the Methane to Markets Partnership. Together,
            they conducted 26 workshops in more than 14 Partner Countries and trained approximately
            2,000 people in all four sectors. The U.S. EPA also joined the government of India
            in organizing the second Methane to Markets Partnership Expo, held in New Delhi
            in March 2010.</p>
        <p>
            The report highlights the U.S. commitment to reduce and use methane emissions as
            well as details on progress in every sector. In fiscal year 2009, the United States
            provided $10.5 million to the Partnership, bringing the total U.S. financial commitment
            to the Partnership to more than $50 million since 2005. These funds have leveraged
            approximately $387 million in additional funding. These and other efforts are successfully
            bringing more than 300 methane emission reduction projects online in 18 Partner
            Countries. In 2010, these projects reduced methane emissions by 9 million metric
            tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMTCO<sub>2</sub>E) per year. When fully implemented,
            they will reduce emissions by approximately 61 MMTCO<sub>2</sub>E annually.</p>

            Cantellano, Mexico's Foreign Relations Secretary and new President of the Conference,
            addressed the 192 delegates in attendance. The 11-day conference included sessions
            related to the Clean Development Mechanism, compliance under the Kyoto Protocol,
            and information on greenhouse gas inventories.</p>
        <p>
            The conference concluded with all nations agreeing to set a goal of limiting a rise
            in average world temperatures to below 2 degrees Celsius. Negotiators also agreed
            to create a Green Climate Fund to provide $100 billion a year to poor nations by
            2020 in an effort to protect tropical forests and share clean energy technology
            (a funding source for this fund has not been identified). Additionally, negotiators
            tried to extend the Kyoto Protocol, which is set to expire in 2012, but there was
            no resolution. Next year's conference will take place in South Africa.</p>

                agreed to work together to develop VAM projects. The mission is to recover and mitigate
                VAM emissions from all suitable current and future ventilation shafts at Walter
                Energy's coal mines. The first project under the agreement will be operational in
                2011, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 330,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent
                (TCO<sub>2</sub>E) per year. Ultimately, the implementation of the entire pipeline
                of projects is expected to reduce emissions by more than 3 million TCO<sub>2</sub>E
                per year. Read the <a href="http://www.biothermica.com/brochure_pdf/PR_BIO_JWR_VAM_20101005.pdf">
