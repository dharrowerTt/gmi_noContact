        <p>
            In April 2011, GMI, with the help of Project Network member <a href="../project-network/pnmProfile.aspx?ID=1637">
                Renewable Energy Agency (REA)</a> in <strong>Ukraine</strong> and U.S. EPA's
            Landfill Methane Outreach Program (LMOP), completed a feasibility study for the
            Chernihiv Landfill in Chernihiv, Ukraine. The feasibility study evaluated the economic
            viability of landfill gas (LFG) collection systems and project implementation for
            the Chernihiv Landfill, where owners had expressed interest in developing an LFG
            energy project. The REA performed a pump test and oversaw the installation of a
            flare to burn collected methane. The feasibility study concluded that the landfill
            is a viable candidate for an LFG energy project. Currently, the landfill is negotiating
            to sell the gas to a nearby district heating facility.</p>

            GMI Travels to Europe</h2>
        <p>
            In June 2011, GMI traveled to Europe to work with organizations in the <strong>United
                Kingdom (UK)</strong> and <strong>Germany</strong> to discuss GMI's expanded
            scope of methane abatement and to learn more about their climate policies and how
            GMI and these two partner countries could collaborate.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>GMI representatives travelled to the UK to meet with the UK Department for International
                Development (DFID), the British Foreign Commonwealth Office (FCO), two Partner organizations,
                the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and the Department
                of Energy and Climate Change (DECC). In addition to discussing cooperation on the
                new GMI scope and directives, officials discussed DEFRA's recently issued Anaerobic
                Digestion Strategy and Action Plan. This plan is an important step to achieve the
                government's commitment to increase energy from waste through anaerobic digestion,
                avoid unnecessary barriers, and provide financial incentives for anaerobic digestion
                projects. Read the <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/publications/files/anaerobic-digestion-strat-action-plan.pdf">

            <li>While in London, the GMI representatives also met with The European Bank for Reconstruction
                and Development (EBRD). GMI learned that EBRD has strong greenhouse gas mitigation
                mandate and is interested in methane opportunities in several their sectors. GMI
                is currently exploring different opportunities to work together with EBRD to develop
                methane projects.</li>
            <li>GMI representatives met with Germany's Ministry of Environment Umwelt Bundees Amt
                (UBA), KfW Bankengruppe, and the Deutsche Gesellschaft f&uuml;r Internationale Zusammenarbeit
                (formerly GTZ), a government agency that provides technical assistance to developing
                nations, to discuss opportunities to assist potential methane capture and use projects.
                Building on mutual goals and technical expertise, officials aim to find common strategies
                to reduce future methane emissions. Discussions with all three organizations included
                the expanded scope of the waste sector and the inclusion of the wastewater sector
                under GMI.</li>

                    Helps Develop LFG Energy Project in Brazil.</strong> In June 2011, Project Network
                member <a href="../project-network/pnmProfile.aspx?ID=91">FirmGreen</a> announced
                delivery of its proprietary biogas cleaning system to convert biogas to highly purified
                methane for a landfill near Rio de Janeiro, <strong>Brazil</strong>. The Novo Gramacho
                Landfill, featured in the documentary <a href="http://www.wastelandmovie.com/"><em>Waste
                    Land</em></a> <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx" title="Exiting Global Methane Initiative">
                        <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>,
                is the site of this new LFG energy project. In 2010, FirmGreen negotiated an agreement
                with G&aacute;s Verde, S.A., the Brazilian company that owns and operates the plant,
                to turn the LFG into energy using FirmGreen's technology. After installation, the
                Novo Gramacho Biogas Plant is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 1.4
                million metric tons each year.</li>
