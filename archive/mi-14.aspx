            Ukraine Passes Coal Mine Methane Legislation</h2>
        <p>
            In June 2009, Ukrainian President Viktor Yuschenko signed important coal mine legislation
            that includes a tax exemption for Ukrainian coal mine methane projects. Starting
            in 2010 and continuing through January 2020, profits from the production and use
            of coal mine methane earned by Ukrainian enterprises will no longer be subject to
            taxation. Additionally, the Ukrainian National Electricity Regulatory Commission
            is authorized to set price limits for methane if its production is funded from the
            state budget. The government plans to grant state support and guarantees to the
            producers and suppliers of energy from coal mine methane to help increase the production
            and use of methane from coal deposits. <a href="http://www.epa.gov/cmop/newsroom/international.html">

            <li><strong>Article in <em>New Scientist</em> Highlights Need to Reduce Methane.</strong>
                In June 2009, <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/">New Scientist</a> <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx"
                    title="Exiting Global Methane Initiative">

                        <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>
                The article explains the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions other than carbon
                dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), such as methane. Since methane traps heat more than CO<sub>2</sub>
                and has a shorter lifespan, methane is a good target for emission reductions. According
                to the article, &quot;the technology already exists, and [methane] reductions would
                be politically and economically easier to implement.&quot;</li>

                manure and agro-industrial waste management systems and illustrates how these measures
                reduce methane emissions and provide a domestic, renewable source of energy. The
                report includes a resource assessment, discusses the most attractive sectors and
                locations, and prioritizes the sectors by potential methane emissions reductions.

                and other stakeholders to develop a coordinated program to reduce methane emissions
                from the livestock and agro-industrial waste sector. They also toured a local distillery

            <li><strong>U.S. EPA Releases New Landfill Gas Model.</strong> In July 2009, the U.S.
                EPA released its <a href="/partners/country.aspx?c=china#t3">
                    China Landfill Gas Model</a> <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx" title="Exiting Global Methane Initiative">
                        <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>,
                built using data on climate, waste characteristics, and disposal practices as well
                as conditions at disposal sites in China. The U.S. EPA incorporated components of
                the <a href="/partners/country.aspx?c=nicaragua#t3">
                    2007 U.S. EPA LMOP Central America Landfill Gas Model</a> <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx"

            <li><strong>International Energy Agency (IEA) Publishes Paper on Methane Policy.</strong>
                IEA's recently released paper, &quot;<a href="http://www.iea.org/textbase/papers/2009/methane_brochure.pdf">Energy
                    Sector Methane Recovery and Use- The Importance of Policy</a>,&quot; <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx"
                        title="Exiting Global Methane Initiative">
                        <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>
                reviews policy options for advancing methane recovery and use in the energy sector.
                During the last few years, the IEA has conducted a series of analyses and studies
                researching this topic. The paper references Methane to Markets assistance to countries,
                such as Mexico, with methane emissions reduction strategies and provides policy
                makers with examples of best practices in methane mitigation policy design and implementation.</li>
            <li><strong>Methane to Markets Presents at Conference in Brazil.</strong> In August
                2009, Methane to Markets presented an update on LFG efforts at the Fifth Seminar:
                Integrated Solid Waste Management in Espirito Santo, Brazil. Participants discussed
                on-going efforts to support the development of LFG projects internationally and
                in Brazil. Other seminar presentations focused on pending solid waste legislation
                and the state's focus on the development of regional landfills. Methane to Markets'
                <span class="red">grant recipient</span>, Fundacao Promar, also presented its work
                to develop an inventory of the state's landfills and to identify LFG project opportunities.</li>
