            <i>“We are here together for one simple reason and that is that methane matters. It
                matters in our fight against global warming, in the quality of our air, water cycle,
                and crop yields. And it matters to our health.”</i> - The Honourable Peter Kent,
            Minister of the Environment of Canada, Methane Expo 2013 <a href="http://www.ec.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&n=6F2DE1CA-1&news=BC74A851-1EAD-4864-BD05-9E273CC19A2E">

                The Expo had something for everyone: high-level plenary sessions and talks, detailed
                technical talks on issues related to promoting methane projects and reductions in
                each of the GMI sectors, educational site tours of methane reduction activities,
                and a poster area that included over 90 methane emissions reductions project opportunities
                and success stories that showcased the real, on-the-ground accomplishments of GMI.</p>

            Other Expo highlights were:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A photo exhibit by Tim Bouldry of people living near landfills and dumps. This exhibit
                was showcased throughout the landfill poster area, highlighting the human benefits
                of moving from open dumps to managed landfills that can then support landfill gas
                (LFG) projects.</li>
            <li>The <a href="/expo_canada13/plenary.html">plenary sessions</a>
                included a panel on international methane financing. Speakers from the Inter-American
                Development Bank, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and SENES Consulting
                provided attendees with information and tools on ways to reduce barriers to financing.
                Another plenary session explored different ways municipal leaders from Canada, Colombia,
                and Sweden overcome common sustainability concerns.</li>
            <li>The <a href="http://www.unep.org/ccac/">Climate and Clean Air Coalition to Reduce

                Initiative met with representatives from cities around the world to provide an opportunity
                to develop action plans to reduce methane and black carbon from the sector by implementing
                solutions such as organics management and methane capture from landfills. Representatives
                from Colombia, Chile, and the Dominican Republic presented the results of the development
                of <a href="http://ccap.org/policy-actions-to-mitigate-methane-in-latin-america/">integrated

            <li>On the margins of the Expo, the World Bank hosted the final meeting of the Methane
                Finance Study Group, whose goal is to develop a series of recommendations for G8
                countries to explore innovative ways to finance methane projects. The Group published
                the <a href="http://www.climatefinanceoptions.org/cfo/files/Methane_Finance_Study_Group_Report.pdf">
                    <i>Methane Finance Study Group Report: Using Pay-for-Performance Mechanisms to Finance

                The report considers whether and how public funds, utilizing pay-for-performance
                mechanisms, could be used to incentivize reductions of methane emissions. The authors
                found that pay-for-performance initiatives should be further adopted for methane
                mitigation and that, over time, pay-for-performance can be used to support methane
                emission reductions for NAMAs, national goals, or bilateral agreements.</li>

        <p>
            The Steering Committee, which guides the work of the Initiative, discussed strategies
            to encourage countries to complete their Country Action Plans, which are used to
            identify specific needs and opportunities for methane reductions. They also talked
            about GMI’s relationship with CCAC, issues associated with financing methane projects,
            and greater sector engagement in subcommittee meetings.</p>
        <p>
            The Steering Committee meeting concluded after three days of discussions and presented
            their decisions at the closing plenary. The action items agreed upon include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improving communication and linkages with CCAC.</li>
            <li>Encouraging all partner countries to develop flexible Country Action Plans to enhance
                information sharing.</li>
            <li>Working with multilateral development banks and other organizations to identify
                and promote funding sources for methane mitigation projects.</li>
            <li>Developing a Partnership report highlighting accomplishments since its launch in
                2004. </li>
            <li>Planning a Partnership-wide meeting for GMI’s 10-year anniversary in 2014.</li>

            meeting, which included updates from Argentina, Canada, China, Finland, Jordan,
            Pakistan,<strong> </strong>Taiwan,<strong> </strong>Thailand,<strong> </strong>and
            the United States. Canada provided a CCAC update on efforts to develop an agricultural
            initiative for the coalition. The Subcommittee also presented for discussion a draft
            report titled <a href="/documents/ag_case_studies_guide.pdf">
                <i>Successful Applications of Anaerobic Digestion from Across the World</i></a>.
            The report highlights the benefits of anaerobic digestion systems and presents a

            During the subcommittee meeting, members gave brief updates on activities supporting
            their strategic methane reduction goals. The representatives from the European Commission
            reported on their new action plan and possible areas for collaboration with GMI.
            Additional country updates were given as part of the technical and policy sessions
            and, in total, ten GMI countries (Canada, China, Colombia, Indonesia, Mexico, Norway,<strong>
            </strong>Sweden, Thailand, the United States, and Ukraine) and the European Commission
            provided updates. During <a href="/expo_canada13/oilandgas.html">
                technical and policy sessions</a>, more than 20 presentations covered several
            key topics, including best practices for evaluating and reducing emissions from
            oil and associated gas production, approaches to methane emission detection and
            measurement, and best practices for capturing and utilizing methane emissions in
            the oil and gas industry. Representatives from Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) and
            Heath Consultants gave a hands-on demonstration of their FLIR GF Series and OPGAL
            EyeCGas infrared cameras, which are used to identify methane gas leaks.
