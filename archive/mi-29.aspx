            Spotlight on Australia: Coal Mining Methane Abatement Seminar Hosts</h2>
        <p>
            On 4-5 September, <strong>Australia</strong>, a leader in coal mine methane (CMM)
            emission reduction innovations and policies, hosted the Coal Mining Methane Abatement
            Seminar in Sydney. The <a href="event_detailsByEventId.aspx?eventId=386">GMI Coal Subcommittee</a>
            met in conjunction with the seminar, showcasing Australia's continued commitment
            to GMI. In addition to committing to reducing methane emissions, specifically, Australia
            is also dedicated to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in general, both domestically
            and internationally.</p>

        <p>
            Under its <a href="http://www.cleanenergyfuture.gov.au/clean-energy-future/an-overview-of-the-clean-energy-legislative-package/">
                Clean Energy Future Plan</a> <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx" title="Exiting Global Methane Initiative">
                    <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>,
            released in 2011 by the Australian Government to mitigate GHG emissions and move
            towards a clean energy future, Australia introduced a carbon price and new programs
            to promote innovation and investment in renewable energy. Under this Plan, the country
            will cut at least 159 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMTCE) of
            carbon pollution in 2020&mdash;equal to removing 45 million cars from the road.
            The Plan has a goal of reducing GHG emissions by 80 percent of 2000 emissions levels
            by 2050.</p>
        <p>
            A key part of the plan&mdash;the carbon pricing mechanism&mdash;was initiated on
            1 July 2012 with a fixed price period that will last for three years. The price
            will start at $23 per ton and will rise 2.5 percent each year. Beginning on 1 July
            2015, the carbon price will transition to a flexible price under an emissions trading
            scheme, where the price will be determined by the market. The carbon price applies
            to more than 500 of Australia's largest GHG emitters, including a large portion
            of the coal industry.</p>
        <p>
            The carbon pricing scheme will be linked to credible international carbon markets
            and emissions trading schemes beginning on 1 July 2015, coordinating with the flexible
            price period. At least half of a party's compliance obligation must be met through
            domestic permits or credits, but up to 50 percent of their liabilities can be met
            through eligible international units. This means that Australian companies can directly
            support abatement in other countries, so Australia plans to leverage its GMI relationships
            to find potential international projects in which to invest.</p>
        <p>
            In addition to the carbon price, the Clean Energy Future Plan also includes assistance
            for many industries that will be affected by the new carbon pricing scheme. The
            Jobs and Competitiveness Program will provide $9.2 billion in assistance between
            2012 and 2015 to safeguard jobs in industries with high emissions and international
            competition. The $1.2 billion Clean Technology Program will provide support to manufacturing
            industries to improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon pollution and conduct
            research and development activities to identify low pollution technologies.</p>
        <p>
            Although the coal industry makes a strong contribution to Australia's social and
            economic welfare, coal also accounts for a significant portion of Australia's GHG
            emissions. In 2010, coal mining accounted for 28.3 MMTCE&mdash;or 5 percent of Australia's
            net GHG emissions.</p>
        <p>
            A small number of existing coal mines have high fugitive emissions and will face
            significant costs with the implementation of a carbon price. In response, the Australian
            Government developed a transitional assistance package for the Australian coal industry
            that recognizes the adjustment challenges faced by the industry. This package includes
            the <a href="http://www.ret.gov.au/energy/clean/ctap/csjp/Pages/CoalSectorJobsPackage.aspx">
                Coal Sector Jobs Package (CSJP)</a> <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx" title="Exiting Global Methane Initiative">
                    <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>
            and the <a href="http://www.ret.gov.au/energy/clean/ctap/cmatsp/Pages/default.aspx">
                Coal Mining Abatement Technology Support Package (CMATSP)</a> <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx"
                    title="Exiting Global Methane Initiative">
                    <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>.
            CSJP is a $1.3 billion package that will provide transitional assistance to help
            the coal industry implement methane abatement technologies at the highest-emitting
            mines, while CMATSP will provide $70 million to support the research, development,
            and demonstration of CMM abatement technologies. The packages will support industry
            efforts to develop technologies to safely reduce fugitive methane emissions, offer
            transitional assistance to the most gassy mines, and support efforts to develop
            abatement technologies for full-scale deployment.</p>
        <p>
            As a first step, Australia's Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism hosted
            the <a href="http://www.ret.gov.au/energy/clean/ctap/Pages/CSAP.aspx">Coal Mining Methane
                Abatement Technology Seminar</a> <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx" title="Exiting Global Methane Initiative">
                    <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>
            on 4-6 September 2012 in Sydney, Australia. The seminar's objectives, other than
            raising awareness of the opportunities provided by CMATSP and how it will be used
            to support technology development and transfer, included connecting the Australian
            coal industry with domestic and international CMM abatement technology providers,
            providing greater information for the Australian industry on future international
            investment opportunities, promoting Australia's expertise and technologies relevant
            to CMM recovery and use, and identifying safety and regulatory issues with the development
            and deployment of CMM abatement technology.</p>
        <p>
            The seminar brought together a range of national and international stakeholder groups
            involved in the development and deployment of methane abatement solutions to consider
            and respond to the issues, challenges, and opportunities associated with the commercialization
            of these solutions. Approximately 145 delegates participated in the seminar over
            three days, which included a day and a half of technical sessions, the GMI Coal
            Subcommittee meeting, and a site tour.</p>

        <p>
            The Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Subcommittee met on 2 July 2012 in <strong>Singapore</strong>.
            The meeting featured a discussion of new activities and resources the subcommittee
            will focus on to promote methane mitigation as well as avoidance strategies other
            than landfill gas (LFG). The co-chairs of the subcommittee plan to email a Web-based
            survey to members to prioritize activities. The subcommittee also held a roundtable
            discussion on Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) for the waste sector.
            During this discussion <strong>Colombia</strong>, <strong>Ethiopia</strong>, and
            <strong>Serbia</strong> presented updates on each of their waste sector NAMAs. Many
            countries expressed a need to standardize the procedures used to calculate baseline
            emissions and methods used to monitor, report, and verify emission reductions achieved.
            The <strong>United States</strong> offered to prepare an assessment of MSW NAMAs
            as well as a framework for monitoring, reporting and verification elements that
            can be used to assist GMI partners in NAMA development. The <a href="event_detailsByEventId.aspx?eventId=403">

            <strong><em>Philippines Registers Agricultural Project for Carbon Credits</em></strong></p>
        <p>
            The Land Bank of the <strong>Philippines</strong> is helping pig farmers manage
            animal waste and turn the captured methane emissions into carbon credits. The project
            is the first animal waste management project in Southeast Asia to be registered
            by United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Land Bank, with assistance
            from GMI and the World Bank, is coordinating and managing the installation of anaerobic
            digester systems that capture methane and generate carbon credits for each ton of
            methane captured. The Spanish Carbon Fund, administered by the World Bank, buys
            the carbon credits, providing the farms with an additional source of revenue. Some
            of the farms will also generate electricity from this renewable energy source. The
            World Bank estimates that once fully implemented, the program will produce more
            than 100,000 carbon credits per year from dozens of pig farms across the country.</p>

            <strong><em>LFG Workshop in Mauritius</em></strong></p>
        <p>
            In September 2012, in Flic en Flac, <strong>Mauritius</strong>, U.S. EPA provided
            support for the <a href="../documents/events_land_120910_agenda.pdf">Coastal East Africa
                Solid Waste Management and Gas to Energy Best Practices Workshop</a> (PDF, 3
            pp, 43 KB). Many of the countries of East Africa and the region's surrounding islands
            lack adequate infrastructure, information, and resources to manage solid waste in
            an efficient manner. The workshop provided information on the elements of integrated
            solid waste management appropriate for the region, including landfill operations
            and maintenance and approaches to reduce methane, such as recycling, composting,
            and developing LFG energy projects in East Africa. The approximately 50 attendees
            shared information and experiences, discussed cross-cutting issues, and learned
            about best practices and appropriate solutions. Presentations included an overview
            on integrated solid waste management, lessons learned, proper landfill design and
            maintenance, status of solid waste management in individual cities and countries,
            and successes and challenges across the region.</p>

            In June 2012, with support from GMI, the Lagos Waste Management Authority (LWMA),
            the Lagos state government of <strong>Nigeria</strong>, and <a href="http://www.c40cities.org">

            (a Clinton Climate Initiative program), organized a workshop on <a href="http://www.lawma.gov.ng/summit/workshop%20program.html">
                Developing Successful Integrated Waste Management Systems</a> <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx"

            in Africa. The workshop included information on LFG energy projects and integrated
            solid waste management. Before the end of the year, LWMA will become the first entity
            on the entire African continent to earn carbon credits from its waste management
            system. The workshop, which included participants from <strong>Ghana</strong>, <strong>
                Sierra Leone</strong>, and <strong>Ethiopia</strong>, was designed for sharing
            LWMA's experience and to help start the development of an African LFG model to calculate
            gas generation and recovery.</p>
