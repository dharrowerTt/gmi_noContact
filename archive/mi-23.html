            Shimamura as its new Co-Director. Monica joins Henry Ferland in providing overall
            coordination to the <a href="http://www.globalmethane.org/">Global Methane Initiative
                (GMI)</a>. She comes from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's)
            Stratospheric Protection Division, where she collaborated with various agencies,
            stakeholders, and regional offices to implement the domestic side of the Montreal
            Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer through the Clean Air Act. Before
            that, Monica served as an air enforcement officer in U.S. EPA's New York regional
            office. She has lived and worked in Australia, Belize, Japan, and the United Kingdom.
            In her spare time, she enjoys traveling, attending music performances, horseback
            riding, and scuba diving.</p>
        <p>
            Monica is looking forward to working with GMI organizations as they move forward
            on projects that are reducing and recovering methane as an energy source. Monica
            can be reached at <a href="mailto:shimamura.monica@epa.gov">shimamura.monica@epa.gov</a>

            welcomed <strong>Jordan</strong>, the first Middle Eastern nation to become a Partner
            Country, on 22 April 2011. Delegates from the country will participate in the Agriculture
            and Landfill Subcommittees as well as on the Wastewater Task Force. Based on data
            from the U.S. EPA's <a href="http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/economics/downloads/GlobalAnthroEmissionsReport.pdf">
                <em>Global Anthropogenic Emissions of Non-CO<sub>2</sub> Greenhouse Gases</em></a>

            report, Jordan's 2010 estimated anthropogenic methane emissions totaled 2.4 million
            metric tons carbon dioxide equivalent (MMTCO<sub>2</sub>E). Landfills represent
            more than 40 percent of Jordan's anthropogenic methane emissions&mdash;1.02 MMTCO<sub>2</sub>E&mdash;and
            an additional 35 percent (0.83 MMTCO<sub>2</sub>E) come from the agriculture (manure
            management), oil and gas, and wastewater sectors.

            which performs studies, research, and experimental projects in new and renewable
            energy sources, will be integral to GMI participation. The Center will contribute
            to creating a biogas industry and market, developing a Biogas Master Plan through
            2020, and building biogas technology capacity. The Center will also embark on a
            country-wide survey of organic waste producers (e.g., cattle and poultry manure,
            municipal solid waste, wastewater, agriculture waste), as well as calculating Jordan's
            greenhouse gas and methane contribution to climate change. The ASG looks forward
            to Jordan's participation in the Initiative.</p>

            GMI Spotlight: Nigeria Advancing Sustainable Solid Waste Management</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="/images/mi23_lfg.jpg" alt="photo of woman at podium" style="float: left;
                margin: 0 10px 0 0;" /><strong>Nigeria</strong> is the most populated country
            in Africa, and many of its rural and urban areas lack access to proper waste disposal
            sites. Moreover, Nigerians have to cope with health hazards and environmental degradation
            associated with these uncontrolled dump sites. However, one woman, Achenyo Idachaba,
            the founder of consulting firm <a href="http://www.greennovativechain.com/">Greennovative
                Chain</a> <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx" title="Exiting Global Methane Initiative">
                    <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>
            is promoting the development of sustainable solid waste management practices. Both
            the public and environment can benefit from improved landfill management and the
            recovery and use of methane as a reliable and local energy source.</p>
        <p>
            With Greennovative Chain, Achenyo donated her time and materials to conduct assessments
            of four landfills in Ibadan, Nigeria. Her analysis, shared at the <a href="/expo/landfill.htm">
                2010 Partnership Expo</a>, indicates that two of the landfills could reduce
            299,000 MTCO<sub>2</sub>E emissions and generate close to one megawatt of energy
            onsite. Now she's working as a subcontractor on a GMI grant to conduct the first
            national landfill survey for Nigeria.</p>
        <p>
            This grant, received by Rutgers University in 2009, builds on a previous GMI grant
            that conducted preliminary site visits and assessments at landfills in two Nigerian
            cities, Lagos and Abuja. In order to complete a national landfill inventory, Rutgers
            contracted Achenyo to collect data, targeting landfills in six other major population
            centers in Nigeria. The goal of the project, as explained by David Specca, Assistant
            Director at the <a href="http://ecocomplex.rutgers.edu/">EcoComplex</a> <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx"
                title="Exiting Global Methane Initiative">
                <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>
            at Rutgers University, is &quot;to help local officials turn dump sites into assets.&quot;
            The first phase of research entailed meeting with waste management authorities and
            landfill managers in Akure, Jos, Kano, Kaduna, Zaria, and Port Harcourt to explain
            the project, and distribute a survey designed to collect information for the GMI
            International Landfill Database. After data collection, Achenyo conducted preliminary
            site assessments at 26 dumpsites and shared results in presentation forums with
            landfill managers to underscore the potential for recovering landfill gas (LFG)
            for energy as well as the economic development benefits.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="/images/mi23_landfill.jpg" alt="photo of landfill" style="float: left;
                margin: 0 10px 0 0;" />The research has taken Achenyo across Nigeria, where
            she has seen &quot;a keen and genuine interest among officials at the local, state,
            and national levels to better understand the benefits of LFG collection systems.&quot;
            The challenges are significant. Several of the state waste management authorities
            lack the optimum number of vehicles and infrastructure to collect solid waste, resulting
            in many illegal uncontrolled dumps. Most of these sites lack bottom liners to protect
            groundwater or soil to cover the waste to protect the public from epidemic outbreaks.
            Open fires and smoke are another health and safety hazard found at the various sites.
            Landfill managers need training about proper disposal practices and resources to
            install appropriate infrastructure and remediation to facilitate LFG capture and
            recovery. However, small measurable steps are taking place thanks to Achenyo and
            GMI's support. Achenyo's meetings with local officials started a dialogue on the
            benefits of LFG energy recovery. The next step is to explore partnerships with private
            companies to begin to improve disposal sites and recover LFG. Ideally, LFG energy
            recovery will provide a revenue stream through the sale of power and carbon emission
            reductions through Carbon Financing such as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)
            as established under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
            In addition, Rutgers hopes to train Nigerian students to manage businesses at landfills,
            such as greenhouses that can utilize LFG as a source for heat and energy.</p>
        <p>
            Developing LFG energy projects requires intensive ground work and collaboration,
            resources offered through GMI. Nigeria has taken an active role in GMI's efforts
            since 2004, when it became one of the first countries to join the initiative. Achenyo's
            efforts exemplify the dedication of many people currently working in the field trying
            to create a reliable, clean energy source and improve local living conditions.

            <strong><em>Agricultural Resource Assessments</em></strong><br />
            GMI supported the completion of livestock and agro-industry resource assessments
            in twelve countries. The objective is to identify and characterize the potential
            for incorporating anaerobic digestion into waste management systems, to reduce methane
            emissions, and to provide a renewable source of energy. Based on the resource assessments
            done so far, more than 54 MMTCO<sub>2</sub>E could be reduced by implementing anaerobic
            digestion systems into the agricultural waste sector (see Table 1). These resource
            assessments, together with feasibility studies and demonstration projects, will
            help serve as the basis for future country-level policy planning and development
            of an agricultural methane implementation plan. Recently completed country-wide
            resource assessments are listed below. All country assessments can be found under
            the <a href="../tools-resources/ag_addresources.aspx">Agriculture Subcommittee's Additional

            <strong><em>LFG Assessment Reports</em></strong><br />
            GMI is conducting landfill-specific assessments at pre-screened landfills identified
            as having good potential for an LFG energy project. In March 2011, GMI completed
            LFG assessment reports for several landfills in <strong>China.</strong> These landfills
            are ready for developers to take to the next stage of development:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <a href="../Data/353_LINGSHANLFGreport.pdf">Lingshan LFG Assessment Report</a>
                (PDF, 66 pp, 3.2 MB) was completed for the Lingshan Landfill located in Shandong
                Province, China. The assessment, funded by a 2008 GMI grant, estimated the gas generation
                and energy recovery potential of the landfill. The report indicates that the site
                produces a moderate and steadily increasing amount of LFG.<br />
                <br />
            </li>
            <li>The <a href="../Data/353_ZHANJIANGLFGreport.pdf">Zhanjiang LFG Assessment Report</a>
                (PDF, 81 pp, 2.8 MB), also funded under a GMI grant, was completed for the Zhanjiang
                Landfill located in Quang Dong Province, China. The landfill is owned by the City
                of Zhanjiang and operated by the Municipal and Landscape Bureau of Zhanjiang City.
                The analysis found that although the site produces a moderate amount of LFG, initial
                indications are that a project may not be economically feasible right now.<br />
                <br />
            </li>
            <li>GMI completed the <a href="../Data/new_HongshantouLFSARFinal_english_Mar2011R.pdf">
                Hangshantou LFG Assessment Report</a> (PDF, 51 pp, 1.6MB) for the landfill in Wupo
                Village, northeast of Xiangfan City, China. The Wuhan University of Technology's
                Design Institute designed the landfill, which is owned and operated by the Xiangfan
                City Solid Waste Treatment Company Limited. The assessment found that the landfill
                currently emits enough LFG to sustain an LFG energy project. With a significant
                and relatively steady quantity of LFG available and the presence of potential end
                users, the site is a good opportunity for the development of direct-use or electricity-generating

                MB). Beijing Chaoyang Circular Economy Industrial Park operates the site. Although
                analysts anticipate that future LFG generation rates will decline due to reduced
                raw waste intake, implementation of improvements can increase the efficiency of
                LFG recovery, thereby fulfilling two main objectives of the LFG management system:

            GMI Hits the Skies</h2>
        <p>
            GMI has been travelling to promote methane recovery and use as a clean energy source.
            Here are some of our highlights:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In December 2010, several GMI- related meetings were hosted in <strong>Indonesia</strong>.
                A GMI landfill representative met with several public and private sector LFG stakeholders,
                including the <a href="http://www.esdm.go.id/index-en.html">Ministry of Energy and Mineral
                    Resources</a> <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx" title="Exiting Global Methane Initiative">
                        <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>;
                several LFG project developers, including Project Network members <a href="../project-network/pnmProfile.aspx?ID=291">
                    Sindicatum Carbon Capital</a> and <a href="../project-network/pnmProfile.aspx?ID=350">
                        Golder Associates</a>; the <a href="http://www.clintonfoundation.org/what-we-do/clinton-climate-initiative/">
                            Clinton Climate Initiative</a> <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx" title="Exiting Global Methane Initiative">
                                <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>;
                the City of Jakarta Solid Waste Department; and the <a href="http://inswa.tripod.com/">
                    Indonesian Solid Waste Association</a> <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx" title="Exiting Global Methane Initiative">
                        <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>.
                At the meetings, they discussed current barriers to LFG energy projects in the country
                and a strategy for providing support to future LFG energy projects. The trip also
                included a visit to landfills in the Jakarta area: the Bantar Gerbang Landfill (which
                recently installed two 1-megawatt GE Jenbacher engines and is adding two more engines
                at the LFG electric generating plant) and the Bekasi Landfill (where they are currently
                flaring the methane). Both of these projects were financed with support from the
                CDM. Indonesia has five other LFG capture projects currently registered with the
                CDM, with one other landfill in Makasser currently flaring a small amount of LFG.
                There are several other larger landfills not yet registered with the CDM that could
                have potential for LFG energy recovery. GMI plans to collect additional data on
                Indonesian landfills to better assess the most promising opportunities for LFG recovery
                and conduct additional follow-up visits to existing projects to help improve the
                LFG recovery rates.<br />
                <br />
            </li>
            <li>In February 2011, a GMI oil and gas sector representative attended the National
                Bureau of Asian Research's <a href="http://www.nbr.org/research/initiative.aspx?id=28">
                    Pacific Energy Summit</a> <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx" title="Exiting Global Methane Initiative">
                        <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>
                in Jakarta, <strong>Indonesia</strong>. The summit convened leaders from government,
                business, and academia to explore innovative solutions to the challenges of energy
                security and climate change. The theme of the summit was &quot;<a href="http://www.nbr.org/research/activity.aspx?id=97">Unlocking
                    the Potential of Natural Gas in the Asia-Pacific</a> <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx"

                        <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>.&quot;
                Over three days, the summit addressed transitioning to a low-carbon economy with
                natural gas, the potentially growing role of natural gas to meet rising energy demand,
                and the current and projected domestic natural gas markets. Papers and presentations
                can be found on the <a href="http://www.nbr.org/research/activity.aspx?id=123">National
                    Bureau of Asian Research's website</a> <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx" title="Exiting Global Methane Initiative">
                        <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>.
                During this visit, GMI meetings were held with representatives of LEMIGAS (Indonesia's
                government research and technology institution operating in the area of upstream
                and downstream oil and gas business) and with a representative of Indonesia's Ministry
                of Oil and Gas to discuss how Indonesia might become more engaged in the GMI oil
                and gas sector.<br />
                <br />
            </li>
            <li>In February 2011, GMI worked with China and the <strong>Philippines</strong> to
                develop a Program of Activities for World Bank Preparation Missions. The China mission,
                based in Hebei Province, is designed to reduce methane emissions from open anaerobic
                lagoons or other high-methane-emitting waste management systems at medium- and large-size
                pig farms. Ultimately, the World Bank hopes to purchase Certified Emission Reductions
                (CERs) from approximately 600 farms. Funds from the CERs can help finance anaerobic
                digesters to reduce lagoon-based emissions and provide technical support to local
                farmers. Identifying participants and disseminating information among farms located
                hours apart are two challenges facing project leaders. In the Philippines, local
                officials met with GMI delegates to discuss the development of the National Methane
                Initiative, which focuses on reducing methane and developing household-scale energy
                systems in the swine sector.</li>

            a state-owned oil and gas company, won Natural Gas STAR's International Partner
            of the Year award. ONGC, a GMI Partner Organization, is one of Asia's largest oil
            exploration and production companies, providing 77 percent of India's crude oil
            and 81 percent of India's natural gas.</p>
        <p>
            The U.S. EPA and ONGC have collaborated on prefeasibility studies to identify and
            estimate major methane emission sources. Based on the results, the company is implementing
            methane mitigation technologies and practices at multiple locations. Specifically,
            ONGC has implemented both inspection and maintenance and flare reduction programs.
            They have additional plans to install vapor recovery units on storage tanks. As
            a corollary effort of working with U.S. EPA, ONGC has set up a leak detection and
            measurement team. ONGC has also established an overall long-term climate change
            vision of carbon neutrality. Their vision and practices are included in their first

            LFG Projects Moving Forward</h2>
        <p>
            LFG projects in GMI Partner Countries <strong>Ecuador</strong>, <strong>India</strong>,
            and <strong>Nigeria</strong> are all one step closer to using methane as an energy
            source. GMI resource assessments concluded that LFG energy projects were feasible
            at major landfills in these countries, and spurred the landfill owners to issue
            requests for proposals to develop LFG energy projects. The landfills with requests
            for proposals, now closed, include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>The Las Iguanas Landfill in Guayaquil, Ecuador</em>. In November 2010, the Municipality
                of Guayaquil released a <a href="http://www.compraspublicas.gob.ec/ProcesoContratacion/compras/PC/informacionProcesoContratacion2.cpe?idSoliCompra=NDk4NzEx">
                    request for proposals</a> <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx" title="Exiting Global Methane Initiative">
                        <img src="/images/exit.gif" alt="Exiting Global Methane Initiative" /></a>,
                seeking a company to help capture, treat, and use the LFG released from the landfill.
                The landfill was featured in the 2007 Partnership Expo; GMI conducted a pumping
                trial and prepared a detailed <a href="../projects/projectDetail.aspx?ID=106">pre-feasibility

                recently issued a request for qualifications to implement a landfill closure, which
                included an LFG collection system at this landfill. The landfill was featured at
                the 2010 Partnership Expo, highlighting the results of a GMI-sponsored pumping trial
                and <a href="../projects/projectDetail.aspx?ID=387">pre-feasibility study</a> of
                LFG capture and utilization. The proposed closure project includes several components,
                such as installation of a liner cover, leachate and LFG collection, and an enclosed
                gas flaring system, along with landscaping on the capped area and associated infrastructure.
                The awardee will also be responsible for maintenance of all the facilities constructed
                under the project for a 15-year period.<br />

                will be held on 4&ndash;6 July 2011 in Marrakech, Morocco. Africa represents a tremendous
                emerging opportunity to establish sanitary waste disposal practices and technologies
                to improve public health and the environment. Of critical importance is the need
                for capacity building, technology transfer, and investment to improve solid waste
                disposal conditions and consequently the lives of millions of Africans. Improved
                disposal sites will also lead to conditions that are favorable to LFG recovery,
                which can yield substantial energy, economic, and environmental benefits (e.g.,
                climate). GMI has been working to improve solid waste disposal practices and advance
                LFG recovery opportunities in Ethiopia, Ghana, and Nigeria. Government officials
                from Africa, as well as representatives from GMI, will discuss current solid waste

                Solid Waste Sanitary Landfill&mdash;the largest landfill in China. In order to become
                more sustainable, the city is working to improve its waste collection system. Currently
                the landfill has a leachate collection and treatment system as well as a methane
