                <br />
                The Steering Committee approved both Ethiopia and Ghana's requests to join the Partnership
                and sit on the Steering Committee. Ethiopia and Ghana will join 31 other Partners
                and increase Methane to Markets' representation from Africa. Ethiopia is looking
                at opportunities for methane capture and use projects in the sectors of manure management
                and landfill management and will be joining the Agriculture and Landfill Subcommittees.
                Ghana is interested in landfill and oil and gas projects and will be joining the
                respective subcommittees.</span> Officially approved Ethiopia and Ghana's application
                to join the Partnership (see side bar).<br />
                <br />
            </li>
            <li>Drafted a revised <a href="../documents/about_termsofreference_en.pdf">Terms of
                Reference (TOR)</a> (PDF, 43 pp, 1.3 MB). The proposed changes include expanding
                the Partnership's scope to include methane abatement, encouraging review of subcommittee
                leadership every three years, and asking Partners to complete and implement action
                plans, as well as periodically communicate their progress and accomplishments to
                the <a href="mailto:secretariat@globalmethane.org">Administrative Support Group (ASG)</a>.
                The Steering Committee also added language to the TOR creating linkages between
                the Partnership and the <a href="http://unfccc.int/2860.php">United Nations Framework
                    Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)</a> <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx" title="Exiting Global Methane Initiative">

                in late 2010. This event will mark the initiation of the revised TOR and include
                a Ministerial Declaration about the importance of methane reduction and the critical
                role the Partnership is playing in international climate change mitigation. The
                ASG will circulate a draft declaration for the Steering Committee to review and
                will provide it to all Partners for comment. The goal is to finalize the declaration
                approximately one month before the Ministerial Meeting. The meeting may also include
                country statements, photo opportunities, press events, and success story posters.

            More than <a href="../activities/indexact.aspx?expo=newdelhi">150 project opportunities</a>
            and success stories from Partner Countries were showcased in two exhibition halls,
            dubbed the &quot;Methane Marketplace&quot; during the Partnership Expo. These project
            posters and flyers gave participants the chance to learn firsthand about project
            details and network with project representatives. The projects exhibited at the
            Partnership Expo have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 17 million
            metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent annually. Rotating success stories featured
            at the Partnership Expo will soon be posted on the <a href="../index.aspx">Methane to

            <a href="../expo_india10/agriculture.htm">agriculture sector</a> activities included a site
            visit, technical and policy sessions, and a subcommittee meeting. For the site visit,
            participants visited the Shri Krishna Gaushala in the Karera Village in Ghaziabad,
            India. A gaushala is a sanctuary for old, sick, and abandoned cows. At the Shri
            Krishna Gaushala, there are 1,000 cows whose manure is processed in three onsite
            anaerobic digesters. Some of the biogas produced by the digesters provides electricity
            for the site; the rest is purified and bottled onsite for use offsite. The <a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in/">
                Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)</a> <a href="/exitdisclaimer.aspx" title="Exiting Global Methane Initiative">

            the <a href="../expo_india10/landfill.htm">landfill sector</a>, breakout sessions covered
            lessons learned in assessing landfill gas (LFG) project potential, methods for improving
            LFG recovery and site safety, and how to develop LFG projects. Especially exciting
            were presentations by representatives of <a href="../partners/argentina.aspx">Argentina</a>
            and <a href="../partners/ukraine.aspx">Ukraine</a> discussing the success of their
            Methane to Market-supported LFG projects. In the three years since the last Expo,
            the Partnership has moved from discussing and planning projects to implementing
            demonstration projects!</p>
        <p>
            Approximately 30 Expo attendees had the opportunity to visit the Okhla Landfill
            in New Delhi. The landfill is one of New Delhi's three operational dump sites and
            has been the site of pump tests conducted by the U.S. EPA. According to preliminary
            estimates, the landfill can produce nearly 2.7 megawatts of electricity.</p>
        <p>
            During the Expo, the Landfill Subcommittee discussed activities for 2010, such as
            the development of a landfill biogas project best practices guide. Based on charges
            from the Steering Committee, they discussed where the new focal area of wastewater
            treatment should be incorporated into the Partnership Structure and if it is appropriate
            to expand the mission of the Partnership to include methane abatement (e.g., flaring
