                    <h3 id="one">1. What is the objective of the Global Methane Initiative (GMI)?</h3>
           	  <p>The GMI is an action-oriented initiative that reduces global methane emissions to enhance economic growth, promote energy security, improve the environment, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Initiative focuses on cost-effective, near-term methane abatement and recovery and use of methane as a clean energy source. This is achieved internationally through collaboration between developed countries, developing countries, and countries with economies in transition — together with strong participation from the private sector. The GMI targets five major methane sources for action: <a href="../agriculture/index.aspx">agriculture</a>, <a href="../coal-mines/index.aspx">coal mines</a>, <a href="../landfills/index.aspx">municipal solid waste</a>, <a href="../oil-gas/index.aspx">oil and natural gas  systems</a>, and <a href="../wastewater/index.aspx">wastewater</a>.</p>
              
              
<br />              
<h3 id="two">2. What countries are participating in the GMI?</h3>
                		<p>The  GMI includes 42 <a href="../partners/index.aspx">Partners</a>, which  together represent approximately 70 percent of the world's estimated  manmade methane emissions.</p>
                        <p>Representatives of national governments with an interest in promoting methane projects can  request to <a href="../participate/index.aspx">join  the Initiative</a> at any time.</p>

<br />
            <h3 id="three">3. What commitments do  Partner Countries make?</h3>
           	  <p>Participating countries sign the <a href="../about/terms.aspx">Terms of Reference</a>, which outlines the purpose, <a href="../about/index.aspx#orgchart2">organizational structure</a>, and functions of the GMI. This document also outlines more specific activities to be undertaken by the GMI, as such:</p>
                    	<ul>
                          <li>Identify cost-effective opportunities to recover methane emissions for energy production.</li>
                          <li>Address barriers to project development (e.g., legal, regulatory, financial, institutional).</li>
                          <li>Foster cooperation among Partner Countries, the private sector, and other organizations.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>All Partners are also encouraged to develop GMI Partner Action Plans. The goal of these plans is to identify the overall vision for a Partner's participation in GMI, outline key country activities and priorities, and provide a mechanism to advance cooperation among Partners by identifying needs and opportunities. The GMI Steering Committee approved <a href="../documents/GMI_RevisedActionPlanningGuidance_June2013.pdf">revised Action Planning guidance</a> (PDF, 7 pp, 191 KB) in July 2015 and asks that Partners submit their plans to the Administrative Support Group for posting.</p>
      
                    
<br />
            <h3 id="four">4. Can the private sector and other organizations participate in the GMI?</h3>
                    	<p>Yes. Active involvement by  private sector entities, financial institutions, and other non-governmental  organizations is essential to building capacity, transfer technology, and  promoting private direct investment that will ensure the Initiative's success. The GMI's <a href="../project-network/index.aspx">Project Network</a> serves as a mechanism to facilitate communication, project development and  implementation, and private sector involvement. More than 1,000 GMI Project  Network members are key to reaching out to and  organizing the efforts of the private sector, the research community, multilateral and regional development banks,  and other governmental and non-governmental organizations.</p>
                        <p>Interested organizations and individuals can submit a request to join the Project  Network by completing the online, non-binding <a href="../project-network/pnmJoin.aspx">Membership  Agreement</a>. View the current list of <a href="../project-network/pnmList.aspx?sector=all">Project  Network members</a> or use the <a href="../project-network/pnmadvancedSearch.aspx">Member Search</a> to find a particular Project Network organization and their contact  information.</p>
                        
<br />
            <h3 id="five">5. What is the difference between a Partner and a Project Network member?</h3>
                    	<p>Partners are countries whose national governments sign the <a href="../about/terms.aspx">Terms of Reference</a> document. Partners appoint delegates to represent their government on each of the  technical subcommittees (i.e., <a href="../agriculture/index.aspx">agriculture</a>, <a href="../coal-mines/index.aspx">coal mines</a>, <a href="../landfills/index.aspx">municipal solid waste</a>, <a href="../oil-gas/index.aspx">oil and natural gas  systems</a>, and <a href="../wastewater/index.aspx">wastewater</a>) in  which they have an interest. Partners may also have representatives on the <a href="../steering/index.aspx">Steering Committee</a>.</p>
                        <p>The <a href="../project-network/index.aspx">Project  Network</a> is a growing community of private-sector entities, financial  institutions, and other governmental and non-governmental organizations with an  interest in methane abatement, recovery, and use projects. Project Network members are  actively involved in the Partnership and are critical to its success. Working  with countries who are GMI Partners, Project Network members can galvanize  action, setting the stage for concrete methane projects.</p>
                        <p>Members of the Project Network are encouraged to attend subcommittee  meetings and participate in developing the sector-specific Action Plans.  Project Network members may also assist in specific activities such as capacity  building, technology transfer, and outreach.</p>
                        
<br />
            <h3 id="six">6. How does the GMI achieve its goals?</h3>
           	  <p>GMI achieves its methane emissions reductions goals by facilitating  public and private sector investment in methane abatement, recovery,  and use projects.  Partners identify barriers to project development and support activities  designed to help overcome these barriers, such as capacity building, <a href="../news-events/index.aspx">meetings and  workshops</a>, technology transfer and other training events, feasibility  studies, and technical assistance. Partners also identify and assess potential  project sites, and clarify regulatory and legal issues.</p>
              
<br />
            <h3 id="seven">7. How can I contact my country representative?</h3>
                    	<p>Partners designate <a href="../partners/countryCommittee.aspx">country  representatives</a> to the GMI <a href="../sectors/index.aspx">technical subcommittees</a>. These representatives  provide additional country-specific information on GMI activities in their country.</p>
                        
<br />
            <h3 id="eight">8. How can I submit a project idea or activity to a technical subcommittee for consideration?</h3>
                    	<p>Partners and Project Network members seeking technical  support, financial support, or consultation are invited to submit <a href="../activities/oilandgasarchive.aspx">project ideas and  activities</a>. <!--You can also view project ideas and activities that have  already been submitted by others.--></p>
                        
<br />
            <h3 id="nine">9. What are the expected benefits of the GMI?</h3>
                    	<p>The Initiative has the potential to reduce methane emissions by more than 180 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMTCO<sub>2</sub>E). To give a sense of  scale, this is equivalent to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>More than 760 Bcf of natural gas.</li>
                            <li>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from nearly 420 million barrels of oil consumed.</li>
                            <li>Annual emissions from 76 500-megawatt (MW) coal-fired power plants.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If achieved, these reductions could lead to stabilized or even declining  levels of global atmospheric concentrations of methane.</p>
                        <p>Facilitating  the development of methane projects will also increase energy security, enhance  economic growth, improve local air quality, and improve industrial safety. More  information about the benefits associated with methane emission reductions can  be found in the

                        <a href="../documents/gmi-mitigation-factsheet.pdf">Global Methane Emissions and Mitigation Opportunities</a> (PDF, 4 pp., 2.5 MB).</p>
                        
<br />
            <h3 id="ten">10. How does the GMI relate to UNFCCC commitments?</h3>
                        <p>GMI is a complementary initiative to a country's  commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  (UNFCCC). GMI helps countries build capacity and provides technical support to  advance methane mitigation projects so countries can use this Initiative to help  support and advance their efforts under the UNFCCC. </p>
