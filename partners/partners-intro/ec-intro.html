    <p>The European Commission is the Executive body of the European Union.<br /><br />
    The countries of the European Union, if considered together as one entity, would rank 4<sup>th</sup> globally in total anthropogenic methane emissions, contributing approximately 448 MMTCO<sub>2</sub>E annually. Approximately 56 percent of its anthropogenic methane emissions&mdash;252 MMTCO<sub>2</sub>E&mdash;come from <a href="../agriculture/index.aspx">agriculture (manure management)</a>, <a href="../coal-mines/index.aspx">coal mines</a>, <a href="../landfills/index.aspx">municipal solid waste</a>, and <a href="../oil-gas/index.aspx">natural gas and oil systems</a>.<br /><br />
    The European Commission has developed a document titled <a href="../documents/EC_GMI_reduction_actions.pdf">Global Methane Reduction Actions</a> (PDF, 15 pp, 257 KB) that describes ongoing voluntary and regulatory methane reduction activities within the European Union, as well as activities with international partners to promote the objectives of GMI to build capacity and encourage the initiation of more methane reduction projects around the world.</p>
