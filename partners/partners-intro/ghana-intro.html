	    <p>Ghana has opportunities for methane capture and use projects in the areas of municipal solid waste and natural gas and oil systems. In the municipal solid waste sector, Ghana welcomes opportunities for establishing waste management standards and constructing engineered landfills with methane collection systems. In 2010, the Government of Ghana announced intentions to develop an Oil and Gas Industrialization Plan as a sustainable model of managing its Ghana's emerging oil and gas industry. A key policy element guiding the oil industry is zero flaring, which provides additional opportunities for investment in the oil and gas industry in Ghana.</p>
