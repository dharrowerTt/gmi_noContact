    <h2>Methane Emissions Summary</h2>
    <p>Annually, the Finnish Government develops a report of the nation’s inventory of greenhouse gas emissions. Preparation of the report, which is submitted to the United Nations, includes collaboration with experts from government agencies, academic institutions, industry associations, consultants, and environmental organizations. In 2022 Finland’s methane (CH4) emissions have decreased by 48% from the 1990 level due primarily to improvements in waste treatment and a reduction in animal husbandry in the agriculture sector. In 2022, the primary sources of methane emissions in Finland were:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Agriculture (49%) (enteric fermentation, manure management)</li>
        <li>Waste (30%) (landfills, wastewater treatment, composting and digestion)</li>
        <li>Energy (5%) (combustion, fugitive)</li>
        <li>Land Use, Land Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF) (16%) (drainage and rewetting and other management of organic and mineral soils: managed wetlands, drained organic forest soils, open burning)</li>
    </ul>
