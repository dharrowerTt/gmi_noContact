    <h2>Methane Commitments and Plans</h2>
    <p>Methane mitigation efforts in Albania are guided by national and international commitments and plans.</p>
    <h3>National</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Albania’s <a href="https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/2022-08/Albania Revised NDC.pdf" temp_href="https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/2022-08/Albania Revised NDC.pdf">Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)</a>, revised in 2021, supports the expansion of methane capture at landfills and establishes a targeted 10% landfill methane capture rate by 2030.</li>
        <li>Released in July 2021, Albania’s <a href="https://www.undp.org/albania/publications/albanias-national-greenhouse-gas-inventory-report">National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report</a> under the country’s First Biennial Update Report to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, documents the latest data on methane emissions and summarizes progress made towards greenhouse gas reduction goals.</li>
        <li>Albania’s <a href="https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Albania NC3_13 October 2016_0.pdf" temp_href="https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Albania NC3_13 October 2016_0.pdf">Third National Communication</a>, published in 2016, summarizes the country’s methane emissions trends with a particular focus on the waste sector, Albania’s main source of methane emissions. Other methane sources include enteric fermentation, manure management, and fugitive emissions from oil and gas processing.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>International</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Albania joined the <a href="https://www.globalmethanepledge.org/">Global Methane Pledge</a> in 2021, agreeing to take voluntary actions to contribute to a collective effort to reduce global methane emissions by 30% from 2020 levels by 2030.</li>
