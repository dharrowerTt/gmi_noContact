    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Finland joined the Global Methane Initiative (GMI) in 2008 and provides ongoing support by serving on the Steering Committee and Biogas Subcommittee.</p>
    <p>The Finnish Government has taken action against methane and intends to be a carbon neutral society by 2035. As a result of its Climate Change Act and collaboration with international partners, Finland has implemented numerous policies to reduce methane emissions, including establishing regulatory standards and promoting biogas production and use. These efforts continue to support significant reductions in methane emissions.</p>
