    <h2>Methane Actions</h2>
    <p>The following highlights actions taken in Finland to address methane, organized by GMI sector. Finland is a member of the European Union (EU), which is an important context for climate policy planning and legislation. Some of the legislation that is relevant also for methane is jointly decided and applies to all EU Member States.</p>
    <h3>Biogas Sector</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In 2021, Finland passed the Waste Act which requires separation of waste, more efficient recycling, and promotes a circular economy.</li>
        <li>Finland has implemented extensive <a href="https://ym.fi/en/waste-legislation">waste legislation</a> through the Ministry of Environment and is considered to be a leader in waste to energy efforts.</li>
        <li>Since 1999, Finland has required the capture and control of landfill gas for most operational and closed landfills under <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eudr/1999/31">EU Directive 1999/31</a>.</li>
        <li>
            European Union’s investment support for biogas investments on farms and rural enterprises is included in Finland’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) Strategic Plan in force from the beginning of 2023. There are also different national incentive schemes for research, experiments, advisory services and investment relating to manure management and increased efficiency of nutrient recycling.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry pilot programme for nutrient recycling provides funding for biogas, manure management, nutrient recycling and carbon sequestration investments and innovations (<a href="https://mmm.fi/en/bioeconomy/good-use-of-nutrients-and-energy/programme-for-nutrient-recycling ">https://mmm.fi/en/bioeconomy/good-use-of-nutrients-and-energy/programme-for-nutrient-recycling</a>).
                </li>
                <li>
                    In addition, there is support for operations relating to nutrient cycling (<a href="https://mmm.fi/en/bioeconomy/good-use-of-nutrients-and-energy/operational-grants-for-nutrient-cycles">https://mmm.fi/en/bioeconomy/good-use-of-nutrients-and-energy/operational-grants-for-nutrient-cycles</a>). This support is aimed at biogas plants producing biogas and high value-added nutrient products from manure.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Oil & Gas Sector</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Finland uses a modern gas distribution network and centrally controlled Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR) system measures to reduce methane emissions.</li>
        <li>As a recent development, the EU’s methane regulation on the reduction of methane emissions in the energy sector (EU/2024/1787) entered into force in July 2024. A "regulation" is a binding legislative act, which must be applied in its entirety across the EU.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cross Sector</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>As of 2020, Finland implements the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1603122077630&uri=CELEX:52020DC0663">European Union’s Methane Strategy</a>.</li>
        <li>Finland became the first country to adopt a <a href="https://www.sitra.fi/en/projects/critical-move-finnish-road-map-circular-economy-2-0/">national circular economy road map</a> with a goal to become a carbon-neutral economy society by 2035. (2016)</li>
    </ul>
